 world_lore:0 "Tharassian is an ancient world, steeped in empires, titanic conflict, and earth-shattering cataclysm. Recorded history dates back well over three millenia, insofar these records have survived the periodic Armageddonesque §Yshifts in the presence or absence of magic§! this plane endures. It is these fluctuations between boundless arcane might and nigh-nonexistent magical potency that define both §Ythe Ages of Tharassian§!, and the societies and people on it.\n\n\nI TÉCHNI TIS MAGEÍAS\n\nAll magic in Tharassian comes from a single source - the §YGate of the Gods§! on §YKel§!, that remote, sparsely-inhabited island lying in the southernmost reaches of the ocean. When the Gate is §Copen§!, magic flows into the world, fantastical creatures awake from a slumber of centuries and great arcanists forge magical artifacts. When it is §Lshut§!, magic has faded from the world. Wizards falter, becoming naught but decrepit hermits. Creatures relying on magic delve deep into mountains or dark forests, slumbering until such a time as the Gates open once again. Artifacts lay dormant, their powers sealed away for another era. The current Age - §Y887 A.t.I.§! according to the §YMarelian Calendar§! - is an era of §Cwaxing§! arcana. Bit by bit, magic has been seeping back into Tharassian for close to four centuries now.\n\n\nNO CHANGE WITHOUT COST\n\nMagic, by its nature, is deeply interwoven with the world when it is present. Whether the Gate of the Gods slams open to vomit forth torrents of raw arcane power, or to drain the world of its magical energies before slamming shut for several centuries, the process is always §Requally traumatic§!. Mountains rise, continents sink, and empires are shattered as the world is forcibly remade at its core. Each time this happens, a §Ynew Age§! is heralded into existence. A new Age may also come to pass by virtue of the world §Ghealing§! from the scars left from the opening or closing of the Gate of the Gods. Tharassian knows §Yseven Ages§!.\n\n\nTHE DAWN AGE\n\nThe Dawn Age is when the first complex civilizations arose on Tharassian. There were some conflicts, but overall, this was the most §Gpeaceful§! era of the world. The tides of magic ebbed low, and monsters were few and far between.\n\n\nTHE AGE OF SUNDERING\n\nThe Age of Sundering began abruptly, when the Gate of the Gods §Rburst open§! and an unstoppable tide of §Cmagical energy§! flooded the world. Entire §Rcontinents sank and rose§! out of the oceanic depths, mountain ranges were buried, forests burned and rivers dried up. As if this wasn’t enough, with the increased amounts of magical energy in the world, §Yfantastical beasts proliferated§!. Dragons took to the skies in unprecedented numbers, every village had a witch or warlock, and angels and demons led armies of the faithful and the damned against one another in the name of their deities.\n\n\nTHE AGE OF WOE\n\nIn the wake of the Sundering, §Rcivilisation collapsed§!, and the sapient races of the world had to fight a long and arduous battle to win back what once was lost. §YRefugees§! of sunken kingdoms §Yfled to new lands§!, their already-low numbers further depleted by ferocious magical beasts wandering the lands. §YNew kingdoms§! are founded on blood, iron and sorcery, warring with each other over scarce resources and powerful magical artifacts. Cults worshipping the godlike creatures walking the lands are plentiful, and most realms face constant existential threats from both inside and out.\n\n\nTHE AGE OF AETHER\n\nAfter centuries of rebuilding, a new era of §Gmagical prosperity§! dawned on Tharassian. Using a combination of §Ythe arcane and the technological§!, wonderful §Cmagichines§! were created, ushering in a §YGolden Age of Magic§!. If there’s ancient magicks hidden in the world, they were made either in this time or in the Age of Sundering, though relics from the latter era tend to be made by gods or beings so powerful they might as well be gods.\n\n\nTHE AGE OF VOID\n\nIn a mirroring of the events of the Age of Sundering, the Gate of the Gods §Cabsorbs most of the world’s magic§! back into it, bringing ambient magic levels back to §Ypre-Sundering levels§!. Arcanotech §Rceases to function§!, and civilizations reliant on it collapse. §YOrdoria retreats into isolation§!, prohibiting the use of magic in their realm. A powerful group of wizards from what would become the §YUnion of Free Ungerdaler Princes§! creates their own §Cplane of existence§! and retreats there until the tides of magic flow strongly over Tharassian once more.\n\nTHE AGE OF THE AUTOKRATIA\n\n§YOnesiphorus Irinthios§! unifies the scattered tribes of the §YTion§! through force of arms and solidifies his rule by waging a relentless campaign against the §RUndead§! forces of §YTydeus Kormortis§!. This culminates in a heroic rescue of the tribe of §YTykinthos§! at the §YBattle of Methyros§!, where Onesiphorus bested Tydeus in one-on-one combat, shattering his army and ending his reign of terror. This timely intervention on their behalf caused the tribe of Tykinthos, once the arch-rivals of the Tion tribe, to swear fealty to Irinthios, thus creating the §YEmpire of Irinthios§!. To the South, the §YUngerdaler Union§! is unified through a mixture of diplomacy and warfare.\n\n\nTHE AGE OF RENEWAL\n\n§CMagic§! seeps back into the world more and more, and wizardry again becomes relatively common, although never to the extent seen in the Age of the Aether. The Dwarven Empire of §YVergallheim§! collapses following the §Rrazing§! of their capital. Irinthios loses a large part of its territory, with §YBilodya§! being abandoned and §YTlarthingia§! breaking free. §YArthenon§! lands in what would become §YIrenthar§!, boasting new and §Runheard of§! §Cmagical powers§!, beginning a campaign to §Yunify the Northern Plains§! that culminates in the founding of the §YGrand Master’s Realm§!. The mages that departed for their own plane in the Age of Void §Creturn§! to the Ungerdaler Union just in time to rescue the army of §YHochprinz Ammermann§! of §YHolzbrenn§! from a §RDemonic§! host. Ever more powerful creatures awaken, and magical knowledge is continually rediscovered."
 ORD_context:0 "§YOrdoria§! is oldest surviving nation on §YLathweyne§!, though it has seen great tragedies befall it multiple times. Once, the country stretched from §YNavandon§! in the far North to §YSchneefilde§! to the South. Alas, those glory days are long gone, and Ordoria is confined to its §Gheartlands§! in the §YOrdorian Jungles§!, their grand empire long lost. Even this heartland is §Rtorn asunder by civil war§!, a group of §RRadical Republicans§! known as the '§YRthaur§!' controlling the §YEastern half§! of the country.\n\n\nA NEW ORDORIA\n\nThis era of disgrace will soon come to an end, however, if the §YKing's Steward§!, §YIsvenith Lothinnys§!, has anything to say about it. Having seized power with his §YTraditionalist§! faction from §YHigh King Galerin Valinthir§!, Lothinnys pursues an §Yexpansionist§! and §RPuritan§! agenda. He seeks to restore the boundaries of the §YFirst Ordorian Empire§!, and §Rcleanse the land of the filthy Humans Dwarves, and assorted other lesser species that inhabit it§!.\n\n\nSTRIFE WITHIN\n\nHowever, his policies have earned Lothinnys many §Renemies§!, both §Ywithin§! and §Ywithout§!. Most pressingly, his iron grip on Ordoria's politics has begun to weaken - §Ythe High King's son§!, §YLarennis Valinthir§!, seeks to upend the Steward's de facto rule and restore his father to a position of power, while also §Ytoning down§! Lothinnys' Puritan policies. This has earned his supporters the nickname of the '§YModerates§!'. The Leader of the §YItheryne Temple§!, §YHistarine Vernythe§!, seeks quite the opposite - he and his §YFaithful§! believe Lothinnys is §Rnot aggressive enough§! and demand an even more thorough crackdown on non-Elves and dissenters alike. With his position under attack, Lothinnys has called a §Ygrand conclave of every Ordorian figure of note§! - nicknamed '§YThe Autumn Debate§!' - in order to settle the matter of Ordorian politics once and for all.\n\n\nSTRIFE WITHOUT\n\nDespite their constant bickering, all three factions agree on one thing - once the internal political situation is stabilized, §Ythe East must be retaken from the Rthaur§!. The civil war has devasatated Ordoria, §Ydestroying its industrial might§!. Not only that, but the Rthaur pose an existential ideological threat to the Ordorian Empire, and must be put down to secure the Elven future - be it Traditionalist, Moderate, or Faithful. Once this is accomplished, there is only one goal worthy of Ordoria - the §Yrestoration of Elven hegemony over Western Latherin.§!"
 ORD_lore:0 "Ordoria is a land of greatest triumphs and deepest humiliations. Originally founded by colonists from the now-devastated Elven homeland to the far West, Ordoria began life as a penal colony centered around the city of Ythelmare. With the advent of the Age of Sundering, the heartland of the Elven homelands to the far west sank beneath the waves, with many of that land's richest escaping by boat to Ythelmare. After a brief spat between the pious locals and the disillusioned overseas elite, those that still clung to the old faith were ousted, and the city-state of Ythelmare was founded on a sense of deep betrayal by the Elves' old gods.\n\n\nFOUNDATIONS FOR GREATNESS\n\nCenturies passed, and new cities were founded by bold pioneers and those with nothing to lose in Ythelmare. Soon, cities like Varinthia, Istaroth and Anthyriss grew to rival Ythelmare, and it became clear the city-state model would no longer hold. Thus was founded the Kingdom of Ordoria, declared to be the 'new Elven homeland'. The borders expanded as the population did, and soon the Elves were within reach of the Oramfell Mountains. Here, the Elves would learn they were not the only peoples to survive the Age of Sundering more or less intact - an Ordorian scouting troupe ran into a Vergall patrol guarding a nearby thaigh. Communication proved impossible, and conflict soon erupted. This lay the foundations for Ordorian-Vergall relations, marred by hostility and bloodshed from the very beginning. A mere four years after initial contact, the First Dwarven War broke out.\n\n\nTHE DWARVEN WARS\n\n\nThe Dwarven Wars were a series of conflicts between the Ordorians and the Vergall Dwarves, lasting for nigh on two centuries. After an initial conflict that saw a brief ceasefire, Vergall forces took the city of Anthyriss on the 110th anniversary of its founding, razing it to the ground and salting the earth to prevent anyone from ever living in that area again. Refugees from the now-destroyed settle in the pastoral village of Vinthyne, close to the Ordorian-Vergall border. Recognizing its strategic location, the Ordorians spare no effort in militarizing this suddenly-booming city post-haste, rechristening the city 'Quwylone' ('Quellion,' in modern Ordorian). The Vergall dwarves would not stand for this fortress right on their border, and they launch another war, to their own detriment. Wielding their magical powers to devastating effect, Ordoria beats back the Dwarves and invades the Mountainhomes, and though the first attempt is rebuffed, their second attempt sees the Ordorians seize the Western Oramfell - and its valuable gold mines.\n\n\nTHE FIRST ORDORIAN EMPIRE\n\nHumbling Vergallheim was a source of great pride for the Ordorians, but it had only whettened their expansionist appetites. Fuelled by the gold now flowing into Ordoria from the Western Oramfell, the Ordorians expanded northward and southwards, into the lands now know as the Northern Plains and the Ungerdaler Union. To the Ordorians, these places are 'Thysgynaur,' or 'Land of the Horse People,' and 'Anthygynaur,' 'Land of the Southern Non-Elven People'. Utilising their awesome magical abilities to project power across the continent and keep its economy running, the First Ordorian Empire was a marvel of arcanotech. Hunting down Human wizards of the North and South alike, the Ordorians forced the Lorthorian Druids of the Plainsmen into secrecy and drove a wedge between Ungerdaler lands and Perkavland. Hitherto, there had been little cultural distinction between Perkavlander and Ungerdaler, but with the Ordorians came steel, laws and architecture, along with cultural influences that forever differentiated the Perkavlanders from their Northern neighbours.\n\n\nTHE THOUSAND YEARS OF HUMILIATION\n\nThis era of arcane Ordorian dominance was not to last, however. The Gate of the Gods slammed shut, ushering in the Age of Void. All things magical ceased to function, and with the Ordorian Empire so reliant on sorcery to float its military and economy, it collapsed utterly. Gone was the Ordorian Empire, or even any notion of an Ordorian nation, as Vergallheim swooped in and split the country into rigidly-separated vassal states. Just before the onset of the Age of Autokratia, the Vergall economy shattered, and it was forced to retreat from its colonial possessions, confining itself once again to the Oramfell. The Ordorian vassal-states became independent through abandonment as much as a desire for indepencence, and soon began vying for local dominance, marking the beginning of the Warlord Age that would last for four and a half centuries.\n\n\nTHE INSKILLYTHAN RESURGENCE\n\nIn the city of Istaroth, a popular reformist military general by the name of Aerith Amyn Vanqys overthrew his warlord superior and established the Kingdom of Istaroth. His first act was to publicly announce his alliance with the city of Quellion, secured in secret prior to the coup. With his flank covered, Vanqys bought himself enough time to develop his civil administration and train his army for conquest. For the next 23 years, Istaroth and Quellion collaborated to conquer the warlord provinces and petty kingdoms that divided Ordoria. At last, after the mysterious death of the Autocrat of Quellion (likely assassinated by Vanqys), Quellion’s territories petitioned to be annexed by Vanqys’s administration. With all of Ordoria in his pocket, Vanqys announced the Revived Kingdom of Ordoria, and crowned himself High King. He took the royal name Inskyllithe, meaning 'Vanquisher.'"
 ORD_lore_2:0 "THE SECOND ORDORIAN EMPIRE\n\nHaving passed several economic and political reforms, High King Inskyllithe dragged Ordoria out of its post-Collapse sluggishness. This culminated in a show of strength in which Ordoria annexed several territories in the Northern Plains. Concerned by these developments, Hochprinz Melinger of Fritzhafen called on Under-Emperor Radulfr Huldeskald, invoking the oaths of the Ancient Alliance. The two lords mustered their troops and marched on Ordoria, its young military unable to withstand the onslaught of combined Vergall-Ungerdaler might. In battle, High King Inskyllithe was slain by seven pikemen - only one of which survived, if barely. His corpse was decapitated and hidden deep within the Vergall mountains. After the total victory of the Human-Dwarven Alliance, Ordoria was split into Western and Eastern halves, in order to permanently devastate the Elven war machine, but the countries quietly reunited over the next few decades once it became clear that neither nation was willing to enforce the split. This division formed the basis for the administrative regions in Ordoria for the next four centuries.\n\n\nTHE DUAL MONARCHY\n\nDefying expectations of yet another civil war, the Ordorian kingdoms agreed to a personal union between their royal families, an arrangement known as the Dual Monarchy. In order to ease the coordination of tasks and administration between the two Ordorias, the Dual Monarchy established a 'steward' system to take on a portion of governance. The role of the Stewards would grow immensely over the next four centuries. As the Altallianz between the Union and Vergallheim came to an end, the Dual Monarchy acceded to demands of the nobility and bureaucracy to unite the Ordorias into a single nation. The Stewardry decisively argued for a Vergall-inspired constitutional monarchy. They asserted that it was the constitutional state institutions of Vergallheim that allowed it to outlast Ordoria on many different occasions. With large portions of the nobility swayed, a united constitutional kingdom was established, but it was not a stable one. Only five years after its founding, hawkish nobles skeptical of the constitutional government threatened the High Queen into invading Vergallheim, weak and distracted by its Zarathum campaigns as it was.\n\n\nTHE UNGERDALER INTERVENTION DEBATE\n\nRoyalist-Traditionalist tensions came to a head during the Third Ungerdaler Succession Crisis. The Royalist faction argued in favour of intervening in the northern Freiprinztümer to 'establish a buffer zone, shielding the Ordorian people from the chaotic bloodshed of the Ungerdaler war' and conquer Stahlhof. And at first it seemed that the Royalist Faction had everything under control when they sent an army to Stahlhof. Their fortunes quickly reversed when it became clear that the leader of this force, General Lithyne, was a fervent supporter of the Nationalists, even going so far as to say that 'No amount of Human land is worth a drop of Elven Blood', and he quickly abandoned his task upon encountering serious resistance. As Stahlhof pushed back against the retreating Ordorians, they began taking sparsely-populated Ordorian border territories, settling Humans there. The Traditionalists propagandized this as a failing of the Royalists, further stoking Puritan sentiment in Ordoria.\n\n\nTHE STEWARD'S COUP\n\nWith the Royalists backed into a corner, clearly unable to trust the army, they resorted to desperate measures. Every higher officer with known or suspected links to the Puritan Traditionalists was relieved of their command, and Royalists put in their place, regardless of competence. When the Grand Master led an army to conquer Dosynnis, this proved to be a disastrous choice - the inexperienced Ordorian commanders led their troops into a shattering defeat, and the army restored its deposed commanders, leading to a popular coup against the Royalist government. Isvenith Lothinnys, Steward to the King, held a speech rousing the people of Istaroth to the Puritan cause, and became the de facto leader of Ordoria.\n\n\nTHE QUELLION PROCLAMATION\n\nThanks to the tyrannical hand of the Traditionalists that saw many non-Elves driven from their homes or killed, Quellion erupts into revolt. After decades of Puritan rule, chipping away at Quellian autonomy and trying to erase regional cultural identity, the final insult by the Istaroth government came in the form of a direct order for the local city guard, which had always refused to fire its non-Elven members, to step down and be replaced by an Elven contingent from Istaroth. The Quellion Watch refused, and a fight broke out, seeing three Istaroth elves dead and two Quellian Watchmen seriously injured. They were sentenced to death by hanging the next week, to great public outrage. Alucien Derathur, civil servant of Quellion, rang the city's tocsin, which summoned the citizenry of Quellion. Derathur gave a fiery speech, urging the people of Quellion to take up arms and storm the Lauthure, the city’s prison, to free the guards. In a burst of revolutionary fervor, the populace breached the gates of the Lauthure, arrested the Istarothian guards and freed the captive Quellion Watchmen. Isvenith Lothinnys was furious upon hearing the news and immediately ordered that the army be sent in to quell the unrest. Derathur gave another speech, this time urging the people of Quellion to form defense columns and defend the city's liberty from the tyrants in Istaroth. Derathur finished his speech by hammering the Quellion Proclamation into the gates of the town hall, where they remain to this day. The nobility attempted to shut down the process of the citizenry arming themselves, preferring to surrender to Istaroth instead, but they are driven out of the city by the common folk."
