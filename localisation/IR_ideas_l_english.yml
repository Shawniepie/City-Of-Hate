 country_race:0 "Dominant Race"
 human_country:0 "Human Nation"
 human_country_desc:0 "This country's population primarily consists of Humans. Humans reproduce quickly and have a nearly unbreakable spirit, but their short lifespans means their craftsmen can't quite reach the heights of mastery that other races can."
 elf_country:0 "Elven Nation"
 elf_country_desc:0 "Most people in this county are Elves. Elves are excellent scouts and produce some of the most artisanal yet fuctional goods in the world, but they reproduce slowly."
 dwarf_country:0 "Dwarven Nation"
 dwarf_country_desc:0 "This country has a Dwarven majority. Dwarves are excellent architects and damn near impossible to dislodge from a fortified position, but their tradition-oriented mindset means they're slow to adapt to new circumstances, and their stature means they're not quite as fast as other races."
 gnome_country:0 "Gnomic Nation"
 gnome_country_desc:0 "The people in this country are mostly Gnomes. Brilliant yet reckless tinkereres, they're great for building wondrous inventions, but are too easily distracted for proper military planning."
 lizardmen_country:0 "Lizardmen Nation"
 lizardmen_country_desc:0 "This country is one of Lizardmen. They are terrifying opponents on the battlefield, but their cold-blooded nature makes them poorly suited for cold-weather activities."
 orc_country:0 "Orcish Nation"
 orc_country_desc:0 "These are Orc lands. Ever belligerent, they make fearsome foes, though their habit of infighting hinders their effectiveness on a strategic level."
 patron_deity:0 "Religion or Patron Deity"
 septism_religion:0 "Septism"
 septism_religion_desc:0 "Septism is the faith of the Ungerdaler Union, loosely based off of ancient Elven legends. It is named after its seven Gods - Hieyrenous, Daskellin, Tergewelft, Anzella, Nurhelm, Hutrig and Bitha. Though it officially does not recognize any other deities, most of its adherents pay at least some lip service to woodland and river spirits. From time to time, a particularly zealous Erzbischof will try to crack down on such animistic practices, but this is a futile struggle, and by and large the Church is happy to turn a blind eye if the populace keeps attending sermons and paying their tithes."
 hieyrenous_patron:0 "Hieyrenous"
 hieyrenous_patron_desc:0 "Hieyrenous is the Arch-God of Wisdom and Wealth, the patron of merchants and scholars alike. As the arbiter of the Gods, he does not concern himself with moral affairs, only legal matters. He will not support swindlers, but getting the best deal by any legal means possible is a laudable goal to him. Similarly, he does not care to what use newly discovered knowledge is put, only that it is discovered. He is harsh, but fair. His priests can often be found as financial advisors, scholars, or legal professionals."
 daskellin_patron:0 "Daskellin"
 daskellin_patron_desc:0 "Daskellin is the God of Fire and Freedom. A passionate and fiery free spirit, his priests seek to topple tyranny and break the chains of oppression wherever they are found (this has unsurprisingly made him very popular with the Rosites). He is kind, but somewhat hot-headed and reckless."
 tergewelft_patron:0 "Tergewelft"
 tergewelft_patron_desc:0 "Tergewelft, the Soil-Father, is the God of Nature. Representing the natural cycle of Life and Death, Growth and Decay, he is seen as above good and evil, simply concerned with maintaining the natural order of things. As such, his priests can frequently be found hunting the Undead, which are considered to desecrate the natural order by their mere existence. To his followers, he is a kind god, but make a foe of him and Nature itself will oppose you."
 anzella_patron:0 "Anzella"
 anzella_patron_desc:0 "Anzella is the Goddess of Trickery, and most people are wary around her priests. Although she is not necessarily a patron of thieves, she often respects their out-of-the-box thinking, and her priests are not above some larceny if they can concoct a clever enough scheme. Ironically, vigilante law enforcers are probably her second-most fervent followers, using as much, if not more, trickery as the very criminals they hunt."
 nurhelm_patron:0 "Nurhelm"
 nurhelm_patron_desc:0 "Nurhelm is the God of War, although he only reluctantly fulfils this role. Unlike most War deities, he does not relish in bloodshed, instead encouraging his followers to end wars as quickly as possible with minimal loss of life. He expects a high code of honour, and any soldiers that harm the innocent while out campaigning are sure to lose his favour. His followers tend to be brilliant strategists and competent in hand-to-hand fighting, often adopting a defensive style of warfare."
 hutrig_patron:0 "Hutrig"
 hutrig_patron_desc:0 "Hutrig, the God of Storms, is as unpredictable as the wind and as destructive as a typhoon if his anger is invoked. He is a kindly deity and looks fondly upon those that save shipwrecked sailors, but it's not unheard of for his temper to get the better of him and send a ship to the bottom of the ocean. Captains are often known to perform good deeds just before setting out on long voyages in order to secure Hutrig's favour. It is rare to find one of his priests on land, bar those that maintain his temples, and those that are often serve as spiritual advisors to lords with many lands close to the sea."
 bitha_patron:0 "Bitha"
 bitha_patron_desc:0 "Bitha is the Goddess of Growth, and she is regarded as the most benevolent of the Seven. Some argue that she is a mere aspect of Tergewelft, but her followers maintain that she is a separate entity, representing psychological as well as purely biological growth. Her priests are often found as mentors, farmers, advisors or other roles in which they can help other living beings grow. Her temples often double as farms or educational institutions."
 krostov_religion:0 "Krostovism"
 krostov_religion_desc:0 "Adherents of Krostov believe in self-reliance and independence. Krostov helps those who helps themselves, and the strong will find his favour in surviving cold winters and rallying fellow worshippers to invade softer lands."
 arthenism_religion:0 "Arthenism"
 arthenism_religion_desc:0 "Half religion, half cult of personality, Arthenism is a new faith, sprung up around the Grand Master of the Northern Plains. Worshipping Arthenon as a God-King, this religion is primarily pushed by the Juridity of Benevolence and followed by the aristocracy."
 lorthorism_religion:0 "Lorthorism"
 lorthorism_religion_desc:0 "The native faith of the people of the Northern Plains, Lorthorism is an animistic faith based on the idea that all life has its own spirit, which are all united in the Great Spirit, Lorthoris."
 sothrism_religion:0 "Sothrism"
 sothrism_religion_desc:0 "The religion of the lands of Hastalia, Sothrism has spread - in a significantly altered form - to the Northern Plains of Latherin with the landing of the Grand Master and the establishment of his Realm. Centered around Spirits of the Sky, Cielmids, and their evil counterparts, Dasalmids, Sothrism is a religion of mysticism, rituals and the balance between Good and Evil, a concept known as 'Sothri'."
 dwarven_ancestor_worship_religion:0 "Dwarven Ancestor Worship"
 dwarven_ancestor_worship_religion_desc:0 "Ancestor worship is found wherever there are Dwarves, and it is an integral part of any Dwarven society. The spirits of the ancestors are believed to inhabit the tools they used in life, granting them spiritual strength. Ancient tools are prizeless family heirloom, containing the spirits of many ancestors, and often far more effective than their age would suggest - a fact that the Dwarves are fond of claiming as proof of their faith."
 itherynism_religion:0 "Itherynism"
 itherynism_religion_desc:0 "The religion of the Elves of the Ordorian Jungle, Itherynism is founded on the concept of the Itheryn. Roughly translatable as 'Axioms of Existence', each Itheryn is seen as a core pillar of life itself. In recent years, the doctrine of the Ordorian Church has been drastically reformed - corrupted, some say - to align with the ideals of the Traditionalist faction, but the Rthaur and many Ordorian citizens practice the old, far more benign, version of the faith."
 itheryn_wisdom_patron:0 "Shalyn"
 itheryn_wisdom_patron_desc:0 "Shalyn, the Itheryn of Wisdom, stands for three types of wisdom; intellectual knowledge, learned experience and common sense. Each is seen to complement the other, and a balance must be maintained, lest the dominance of one form corrupts the other two."
 itheryn_vengeance_patron:0 "Harquiss"
 itheryn_vengeance_patron_desc:0 "Harquiss, the Itheryn of Vengeance, demands of its believers that they avenge slights against oneself, slights against one's loved ones, and slights against one's family. In recent years, the Ordorians have added slights to one's race to this, but this is not recognized by many outside of the Traditionalist and Faithful factions. The name of this Itheryn is also a common Ordorian battle-cry."
 itheryn_labour_patron:0 "Lombrin"
 itheryn_labour_patron_desc:0 "Lombrin, the Itheryn of Labour, dictates that one must labour diligently, one must labour honestly, and one must labour safely. It mandates hard work when the situations calls for it, but so too does it demand that its adherents take breaks and do not work themselves into an early grave. Needless to say, this Itheryn is favoured by the Rthaur government, as well as many Ordorian peasants and other common folk."
 itheryn_justice_patron:0 "Venthys"
 itheryn_justice_patron_desc:0 "Venthys, the Itheryn of Justice, expects that its followers act justly themselves, promote just actions amongst others, and uphold just decisions made by others. It expects respect for the natural order of things, claiming that the universe tends to justice when left alone, but makes room for legitimate complaints against unjust situations. This Itheryn is the second most popular in Rthauiaur, and has been accorded less and less respect by the Ordorian Church over the past few decades."
 ouborism_religion:0 "Ouborism"
 ouborism_religion_desc:0 "Ouborism is native to the Lizardmen of Tlarthingia, and its deity is as scaly as its followers. Ouboros, the Great Drake, created the world when he laid it as an egg, and when the end of all things comes, he shall devour it, before starting the cycle anew. He is seen as a distant god, but not an uncaring one. He does not grant boons or respond to prayers, but his flock feels safe in the knowledge that Ouboros is always watching over them."
 molten_god_religion:0 "Church of the Molten God"
 molten_god_religion_desc:0 "The Molten God, whose name was melted away when he was cast in the Fires of Creation by his arch-nemesis, known only as the Putrid, is a deity of technology and metalworking. His followers revere the creation of new inventions as a sacred act, and hope to one day forge a machine that can pull their deity out of the flames and reforge his divine metal body."
 damokegol_religion:0 "Temple of Damokegol"
 damokegol_religion_desc:0 "Damokegol, the Slaying Word, is a powerful Demon of the Underrealms. Although not quite yet at the level of godhood, he is ever scheming to usurp the leadership of the forces of Evil, and to this end is cultivating a cult of worshippers on Tharassian."
 selenism_religion:0 "Church of Selin"
 selenism_religion_desc:0 "Selin, the Creator of all who resides in the Moon, is worshipped throughout Irinthios. Religious ceremonies are held during full moons, and being born during high tide is seen as a sign of good luck. Lunar eclipses caused by Selin's eternal fight with the demon Dysaratos, and are signs of Selin temporarily being outmatched. As such, these rare occurences spark great fear among the faithful of Selin."
