 news.1.t:0 "Traditionalist Victory in Ordoria"
 news.1.d:0 "Though Ordoria has grown increasingly isolationist and xenophobic over the past centuries, some rumours still spread. It appears that the ruling elite has held a Congress of sorts, in which they debated the future of their nation. The Traditionalists, who have led the country since the de facto coup in 819 A.t.I., maintained their grip on governance. Their policy, though not as agressive as members of their Church advocated, is still highly expansionist and supports the doctrine of Elven supremacy."
 news.1.a:0 "The Puritans solidify their control."
 news.1.b:0 "Onward, to glory!"
 news.1.c:0 "We must prepare our defenses."
 news.2.t:0 "Faithful Victory in Ordoria"
 news.2.d:0 "Though Ordoria has grown increasingly isolationist and xenophobic over the past centuries, some rumours still spread. It appears that the ruling elite has held a Congress of sorts, in which they debated the future of their nation. The Faithful faction, comprised of influential priests and the more pious among the nobility, has carried the day. Though they share much in terms of worldview with the Traditionalists, they advocate a more agressive stance to the non-Elves than the Puritans do. Rumours are that the nations is preparing itself for a 'Crusade' against non-Elves."
 news.2.a:0 "They are a zealous lot."
 news.2.b:0 "By the tenets of Harquiss, we will prevail!"
 news.2.c:0 "Their corruption of the Itheryn's teachings will not save them!"
 news.3.t:0 "Royalist Victory in Ordoria"
 news.3.d:0 "Though Ordoria has grown increasingly isolationist and xenophobic over the past centuries, some rumours still spread. It appears that the ruling elite has held a Congress of sorts, in which they debated the future of their nation. In a surprise victory, the Moderate faction, comprised of anti-Traditionalists and royalists, has emerged victorious. Though still believing Elves are superior to other races, they do not take this to the genocidal levels of the other factions, instead being more concerned with securing Ordoria's continued existence, primarily focussing on putting down the Rthaur revolution."
 news.3.a:0 "It is good to see the triumph of common sense."
 news.3.b:0 "For King and Country!"
 news.3.c:0 "Dark days are ahead."
 news.4.t:0 "Governmental Deadlock in Ordoria"
 news.4.d:0 "Though Ordoria has grown increasingly isolationist and xenophobic over the past centuries, some rumours still spread. It appears that the ruling elite has held a Congress of sorts, in which they debated the future of their nation. Though there were fierce debates stretching many days, no clear victor has emerged from between the three factions. Putting aside their differences, the Traditionalist and Faithful factions have united against the Moderates. Though they are able to rule the country, this disunity has weakened Ordoria."
 news.4.a:0 "Ordorian politics appear unstable."
 news.4.b:0 "Our government stands united against the vermin!"
 news.4.c:0 "Hah! Divided they shall fall!"
 news.5.t:0 "Traditionalist Civil War in Ordoria!"
 news.5.d:0 "Though the Moderates have been in charge of the country for a brief while, they have not been able to consolidate their rule properly. With several public failures of their foreign policy, the humiliation has become too much for the more militant Traditionalists of the country, who have declared the government illegitimate and seized the capital of Istaroth. The Military Academy in Vuid, too, has declared for the Traditionalists and seized the city. It appears Ordoria is now in a state of civil war."
 news.5.a:0 "Ordoria is in crisis."
 news.5.b:0 "Death to the weak!"
 news.5.c:0 "For King and Country!"
 news.5.e:0 "We don't even have to do anything for their state to collapse..."
 news.6.t:0 "Failed Traditionalist Coup in Ordoria"
 news.6.d:0 "Although the Moderate faction, spiritual successor to the Royalists, has reasserted its control over the nation of Ordoria, not everyone supports them. Today, several Military Academy cadets, high-ranking priests and fanatical Elven supremacists tried to seize control of the machinations of Ordorian government. Fortunately for the Moderates, their succesful policies have made them immensely popular, and the coup was quickly put down by loyalist army elements and patriotic citizens."
 news.6.a:0 "The Moderates have asserted themselves."
 news.6.b:0 "Treason is punishable by death."
 news.6.c:0 "A shame they didn't cause more damage."
 news.7.t:0 "Traditionalists Seize Power in Ordoria!"
 news.7.d:0 "While the Moderates managed to emerge victorious from the recent Autumn Debate, their grip on power has always been tenuous. Today, that grip was finally shattered, as a large section of the army declared for the Traditionalists and orchestrated a coup. Having seized several key locations and executed several influential Moderates for treason, it appears that the coup has been succesful. The Traditionalists once again rule Ordoria."
 news.7.a:0 "Can those Elves have a government for longer than a season?"
 news.7.b:0 "Ordorian greatness has been saved."
 news.7.c:0 "At least we won't have to worry about them having any friends."
 news.8.t:0 "Restoration of Zarathum!"
 news.8.d:0 "Today, [GetDateText], Dwarves have returned to the city of Zarathum. Six times before, various Dwarven clans have tried to retake the city, but none held the city for longer than a few years. Now, with the entire might of a nation behind the effort, Zarathum has been restored to its former glory, and it is unlikely anything short of total catastrophe will dislodge the Dwarves from their ancestral home. Thousands of Dwarves, a sizable chunk of which are old enough to remember the Fall of Vergallheim, are already flocking to the city, and the first forays to reclaiming the ancient treasures of the Great Bank of Vergallheim have already begun."
 news.8.a:0 "The Ancestors smile upon this day!"
 news.8.b:0 "The Dwarves have returned home at last."
 news.8.c:0 "If only it could have been us..."

 random.1.t:0 "An Artifact in the Mountains?"
 random.1.d:0 "Rumours of a powerful magical item in the Weltsäule Mountains have reached court today. The reports conflict as to the exact nature of this object, but all agree it is a powerful boon to whoever wields it."
 random.1.a:0 "Organize an expedition at once!"
 random.1.b:0 "We have better things to do than hunt after rumours."
 random.2.t:0 "Expedition Reaches the Mountains"
 random.2.d:0 "Today, just before sunset, the expedition arrived at the edge of the Weltsäule. They are restocking in a small town in the shadow of the nearest peaks and are preparing to set out at first light tomorrow."
 random.2.a:0 "We draw close to our goal."
 random.2.b:0 "Turn back, it's too dangerous."
 random.3.t:0 "A Guiding Light?"
 random.3.d:0 "An old man who claims to know the path to our destination has offered his services as a guide. Though some of our men regard him as somewhat shifty, he might significantly increase our chances of success."
 random.3.a:0 "Hire him, a guide could be useful."
 random.3.b:0 "This man is clearly a thief."
 random.4.t:0 "A Magical Ring!"
 random.4.d:0 "After delving through ancient ruins, avoiding many deadly traps and boisterous monsters, our expedition has uncovered a golden ring set with a single sapphire. The legends written on the wall it was found in, in Dwarvish, turned out to be the story of an ancient Dwarven Emperor who wore the ring and was bestowed with untold riches."
 random.4.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 random.5.t:0 "A Magical Sword!"
 random.5.d:0 "After delving through ancient ruins, avoiding many deadly traps and boisterous monsters, our expedition has uncovered a magical sword, sharp despite its age. The legends written on the wall it was found in, in Dwarvish, turned out to be the story of an ancient barbarian warlord who wielded this blade. None could stand before him."
 random.5.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 random.6.t:0 "A Thief Among Us!"
 random.6.d:0 "It turns out we should not have hired the guide after all. This morning, the expedition woke up to find both the old man and the artifact gone."
 random.6.a:0 "Curses!"
 random.7.t:0 "The Expedition Returns"
 random.7.d:0 "Today, the expedition has returned to the capital, proudly displaying the artifact they recovered before handing it over to our ruler. Even if it is not magical, this show of power and prestige has greatly impressed the masses."
 random.7.a:0 "A glorious day!"
 random.8.t:0 "Naught but Dust and Stones"
 random.8.d:0 "Alas, it seems that our expedition has been unsuccesful. Our men spent a week searching the area where the tomb with the artifact should be, but all they found were rocks and insects. They have returned empty-handed."
 random.8.a:0 "A shame."
 generic.1.t:0 "Governmental Crisis!"
 generic.1.d:0 "Our country is in uproar against the current government, with citizen militias of various convictions erecting makeshift barricades and clashing with the town watch! There have even been reports of army defections to the rebels, and the situation is spiralling out of control - what should we do?"
 generic.1.a:0 "This is clearly the work of seditious foreigners!"
 generic.1.b:0 "The old ways are tried and true, we must cling to the nobility!"
 generic.1.c:0 "We've had enough of your corrupt aristocracy - let the people be heard!"
 generic.1.e:0 "Piety and prayer are the only answers to these dire times!"
 generic.2.t:0 "Puritan Coup!"
 generic.2.d:0 "Having made gains in all strata of societies lately (except, obviously, the racial minorities), the Puritans have increased in power and influence to the point where they have successfully staged a coup! Our government officials have been swiftly arrested by Puritan army elements, and those that have professed a pro-xenos bent have been dealt with. It seems that the new regime has secured their power base quickly - so quickly, in fact, that this must have been a very well-planned coup."
 generic.2.a:0 "At long last, we can purge the xenos from our lands!"
 generic.3.t:0 "Order Maintained"
 generic.3.d:0 "The nobility has acted quickly, with the monarch and the aristocrats setting aside their differences to unite against those that would threaten the stability of the nation. The unrest in the streets has died down, and the nobility is already back to its old infighting..."
 generic.3.a:0 "The monarch cleverly check-mates the aristocracy and seizes unrestrained power!"
 generic.3.b:0 "The monarch and the aristocrats negotiate a compromise!"
 generic.3.c:0 "The aristocracy pressures the monarch into handing over his powers to the aristocracy!"
 generic.4.t:0 "Call for Elections!"
 generic.4.d:0 "Tensions in the country have reached a breaking point, and the various disorganized riots have transformed into an organized revolution! Although a civil war seemed imminent, this was prevented by the defection of the Royal Guard, who have placed the monarch and most powerful nobles under arrest! Emergency elections have been scheduled - who shall lead our newly-forged Republic?"
 generic.4.a:0 "The Guildists emerge victorious - liberty for all!"
 generic.4.b:0 "The Rosites carry the day - justice for all!"
 generic.5.t:0 "Religious Coup!"
 generic.5.d:0 "The increased piety in our country as a whole and our government in particular has led to a massive growth in the power of the Church, and they have finally acted - the priests have declared themselves the new government, denouncing the old regime as sinful and heretical, and the majority of the population seems to accept this decree for now. The old rulers have been apprehended by zealous elements of the army and are now awaiting divine judgement."
 generic.5.a:0 "Praise be!"
 generic.6.t:0 "The Royal Front"
 generic.6.d:0 "The situation is dire - dire enough to force even the aristocrats to stop their factionalism and infighting for the moment, and present an united front against the threat of mob rule. The various nobles of our nation have raised their banners alongside those of our monarch, and the army is being sent out across the country to put down the uprisings that plague our nation."
 generic.6.a:0 "Everything must be done to keep the commoners in their place."
 generic.7.t:0 "The Republican Front"
 generic.7.d:0 "There appears to have been contact between the various rebel groups that have consolidated out of the protest mobs, and it appears this is bad news - they have put aside their differences for now and stand united against our regime!"
 generic.7.a:0 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 generic.8.t:0 "A Shameful Display"
 generic.8.d:0 "A scandal has rocked the halls of power today as the two top advisors on economic matters have physically assaulted one another in the middle of a debate! One advisor, the representative of the merchant class, insists on giving the Guilds a free hand in economical matters, while our Minister of Economics claims we should do away with the Guilds! It is clear we cannot keep both at court - whose advice should we heed?"
 generic.8.a:0 "The Guilds are the hearts and soul of our prosperity!"
 generic.8.b:0 "The Guilds are an outdated institution with no place in a modern society!"
 generic.9.t:0 "Officers Brawl!"
 generic.9.d:0 "Embarrassing news form a rather agitated innkeeper today - apparently, a general and an admiral were having a drink in her tavern today, discussing the merits of the army versus the navy. Polite disagreement rapidly heated up into a fist-fight, which sparked a tavern brawl that attracted further soldiers and sailors to fight for their respective officers! We have already paid damages to the innkeep, but we must resolve the army-navy dispute before such a thing happens again."
 generic.9.a:0 "The army must always come first!"
 generic.9.b:0 "The navy is vital to our continued prosperity and must be prioritized!"
 generic.10.t:0 "The Best Laid Plans..."
 generic.10.d:0 "An incident has been bought to our attention today - in an otherwise irrelevant border skirmish with one of our neighbours, one of our generals apparently led his men to charge our own troops, seemingly in the belief that he had 'outmaneuvered a hostile force' and was 'saving the day with a glorious charge'. It is clear our current military staff is not up to standards, and those few competent generals we have are all squabbling over whose doctrine we should adopt."
 generic.10.a:0 "If they'd been cavalry, they would've been able to actually flank!"
 generic.10.b:0 "This would have never happened with a professional army!"
 generic.10.c:0 "Who cares? We have plenty of peasants."
 generic.10.e:0 "Better organization and discipline will prevent future incidents."
 ir.political.5.t:0 "End of the Civil War!"

 merc.1.d:0 "The mercenary warriors of Perkavland have served our armies for the six months their contract stipulated, and we now have to decide if we wish to extend it."

 alliance.3.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 alliance.4.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Join our War!"
 alliance.4.d:0 "It seems our relatives in [From.GetName] have no interest in defending their kin. They have not made any attempts to join us in our war, and beyond some token words of encouragement, it seems we cannot rely on help from their corner."
 alliance.4.a:0 "That is too bad."
 ord.1.t:0 "The Autumn Debate Commences"
 ord.1.d:0 "It has taken a long time to organise the summit and send out the invitations, but at long last all important nobles, priests and other prominent figures of Ordoria have been assembled in Varinthia. From the start it is clear that three rough factions have formed: the Moderates, under the leadership of King Galerin Valinthir, the Traditionalists, led by the King's Steward, Isvenith Lothinnys, and the Faithful, the religious faction commanded by the High Priest, Histarine Vernythe. These three factions will now struggle with each other over the future of Ordoria."
 ord.1.a:0 "Let us hope for a swift and fruitful debate."
 ord.2.t:0 "Domestic-Economic Policy"
 ord.2.d:0 "The first point of debate is the treatment of the other races in our country, as well as our economic plans. The Traditionalists argue for the immediate enslavement of all 'sub-Elven vermin' and putting them to work in labour camps for their heavy industrialization programs, while the Faithful propose witch hunts and religious courts to deal with the vermin, relying on Ordorian labour alone to build a war economy and relying on a swift reconquest of our Eastern lands to salvage our civilian economic situation. The speaker for the Moderates on this matter, where the faction is a definite minority, was almost booed off the speaker's platform when she suggested allowing the most skilled 'demi-Elves' to stay and work."
 ord.2.a:0 "The Moderates' economic arguments sway the powerful with promises of wealth!"
 ord.2.b:0 "The Traditionalists sweep the debate easily."
 ord.2.c:0 "The fiery rhetoric of Vernythe carries the day for the Faithful!"
 ord.3.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ord.3.d:0 "With the matter of the treatment of the other races settled, the topic of foreign policy has come up. Perhaps surprisingly, the seemingly most popular plan is the Moderates' proposal for a temporary alliance with the Realm and the Union, so we can focus on dealing with the rebels, who they consider the 'real' enemy. Meanwhile, both the Traditionalists and the Faithful argue for agressive expansionism, though the Faithful insist on a more spiritual bent to our endeavours than the Traditionalists."
 ord.3.a:0 "The Moderates' plan for Rthaur containment wins over the nobles!"
 ord.3.b:0 "Lothinnys' doctrine of Ordorian hegemony sways the warmongers!"
 ord.3.c:0 "The Faithful proposal for an Extermination Crusade resonates with the zealous!"
 ord.4.t:0 "Military Policy"
 ord.4.d:0 "As debate around foreign policy dies down, the army's current state is called into question. It is clear that some reforms are needed, but what direction should we go in?"
 ord.4.a:0 "Rapid raiding parties can strike terror in the hearts of our enemies - the Moderates!"
 ord.4.b:0 "We must stop losing ground before thinking of conquests - the Traditionalists!"
 ord.4.c:0 "We've been on the back foot for long enough - the Faithful army of aggression!"
 ord.5.t:0 "Moderate Victory!"
 ord.5.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Moderates have come out on top! Many of our more conservative assembly members have loudly protested this, but it seems that, for now at least, our policy of Elven supremacy will be abandoned in favour of realpolitik and a more overt anti-Radicalism."
 ord.5.a:0 "For too long have we made enemies. It's time to look for some friends, instead."
 ord.6.t:0 "Traditionalist Victory!"
 ord.6.d:0 "It appears that the Traditionalist faction has emerged victorious from the summit. We will have to alter some parts of our government, of course, as compromises had to be made, but by and large we shall carry on as before."
 ord.6.a:0 "Domestic stability has been secured. Next stop: Quellion!"
 ord.7.t:0 "Faithful Victory!"
 ord.7.d:0 "The religious convictions and fierce oratory of the Faithful has seen them convince the summit of their Crusade plans. Already orders have been sent to weaponsmiths across the nation to ramp up their production - the holy cleansing of the continent shall no doubt begin soon."
 ord.7.a:0 "Praise the Seven!"
 ord.8.t:0 "Deadlock: Traditionalist-Faithful Coalition"
 ord.8.d:0 "The assembly seems very divided, and no faction has managed to gain the upper hand. To allow for any governance at all, and more importantly to stop the Moderates from gaining traction, the Traditionalists and the Faithful have hashed out a compromise both can tolerate. Neither side is happy with the agreement, but they agree it's better than letting the Moderates have their say."
 ord.8.a:0 "Anything to keep the Moderates out!"
 ord.9.t:0 "The Union Listens"
 ord.9.d:0 "To the surprise of some of our diplomats, High Princess Adelina has decided to hear us out! We have offered her a pact of non-aggression, to grow into an alliance once Arthenon responds, in exchange for the return of certain territories lost to the enroaching Stahlhoffers. However, our advisors are divided on how much we should ask for - if we demand too much, we risk angering the High Princess, or the Prince of Stalhof..."
 ord.9.a:0 "Stahlhof is to return all unjustly seized land!"
 ord.9.b:0 "We will be happy with the return of our most important provinces - for now."
 ord.9.c:0 "We'll cut them a deal - Ghithys and Ancyte for the return of Utrocyle and Ythlycthis"
 ord.10.t:0 "The Union Rejects Our Overtures"
 ord.10.d:0 "Our ambassadors to the Union have returned without success. Apparently, Adelina's court treated them with scorn - one general even spat in the face of our most respected envoy! This has reflected extremely poorly on the Moderates - there's rumours of seditions. One more blunder like this and our enemies might attempt a coup!"
 ord.10.a:0 "Damn them!"
 ord.11.t:0 "The Union Agrees!"
 ord.11.d:0 "High Princess Adelina has decided to support our demands! An order has been sent to the Freeprincedom to immediately vacate all of our lands, and our army stands ready to reoccupy the provinces - whether Stahlhof allows us to or not."
 ord.11.a:0 "Let's hope Stahlhof complies..."
 ord.12.t:0 "The Union Declines!"
 ord.12.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems we asked too much of the Ungerdaler Union - our diplomats have returned with empty hands. Our enemies at court are laughing behind our backs - we'd better score a victory soon, or they might make a move..."
 ord.12.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.13.t:0 "The Union Agrees!"
 ord.13.d:0 "It was a wise move to make modest demands - High Princess Adelina has backed our demands! Stahlhof is now facing pressure from both us and their overlord to return Utrocyle and Ythlycthis."
 ord.13.a:0 "Let's hope Stahlhof complies..."
 ord.14.t:0 "The Union Declines!"
 ord.14.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems even our limited demands were too much for the Ungerdaler Union - our diplomats have returned with empty hands. Our enemies at court are laughing behind our backs - we'd better score a victory soon, or they might make a move..."
 ord.14.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.15.t:0 "The Union Agrees!"
 ord.15.d:0 "Good news - High Princess Adelina has agreed to our suggested exchange of territories! Our troops are vacating Ghithys and Ancyte, along with some Traditionalists and Faithful who do not want to live under Human rule, and now stand ready to reclaim Utrocyle and Ythlycthis."
 ord.15.a:0 "Let's hope Stahlhof complies..."
 ord.16.t:0 "Arthenon Agrees"
 ord.16.d:0 "Excellent news from the North - the Grand Master has agreed to our suggestion of a non-aggression pact, to be formalized into an alliance at the earliest possible opportunity! This has greatly enhanced the prestige of the Moderates."
 ord.16.a:0 "Just as planned!"
 ord.17.t:0 "The Realm Rejects our Proposal"
 ord.17.d:0 "Bad news from the north - Arthenon has decided to not sign our pact. This is a problem for the Moderate faction, whose competence is called into question."
 ord.17.a:0 "Damn him!"
 ord.18.t:0 "Stahlhof Submits!"
 ord.18.d:0 "Word has reached us that the Freeprincedom of Stahlhof has seen reason and agreed to return our lands to us. This has greatly enhanced the legitimacy of the Moderate government."
 ord.18.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ord.19.t:0 "Stahlhof Refuses!"
 ord.19.d:0 "Despite direct orders from the High Princess, the Prince of Stahlhof refuses to return our lands! On the upside, the Ungerdaler diplomats at our court have subtly let us know that the Union would not intervene if we were to take what is ours by force..."
 ord.19.a:0 "Teach them a lesson!"
 ord.19.b:0 "Back down for now."
 ord.20.t:0 "Stahlhof Submits!"

 ord.21.d:0 "Despite direct orders from the High Princess, the Prince of Stahlhof refuses to return our lands! On the upside, the Ungerdaler diplomats at our court have subtly let us know that the Union would not intervene if we were to take what is ours by force..."

 ord.23.d:0 "Despite direct orders from the High Princess, the Prince of Stahlhof refuses our suggestion of exchange! On the upside, the Ungerdaler diplomats at our court have subtly let us know that the Union would not intervene if we were to take what is ours by force..."
 ord.23.a:0 "Teach them a lesson!"
 ord.23.b:0 "Back down for now."
 ord.24.t:0 "Southern Lands Reclaimed"
 ord.24.d:0 "People across our proud nation are celebrating as word has reached us that we have fully reclaimed our lands to the South! The Stahlhoffers have been expelled, and those displaced by the enroaching Humans are slowly returning to their homes. This is a great day for Ordoria!"
 ord.24.a:0 "A testament to Elven might!"
 ord.25.t:0 "The Union Declines!"
 ord.25.d:0 "Despite our extremely generous offer, the Ungerdaler Union has seen fit to reject our proposal - there is an outcry, and even some of our Moderate councillors are beginning to doubt our government's current course..."
 ord.25.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.26.t:0 "Traditionalist Coup Fails!"
 ord.26.d:0 "Our country was in shock today as word spread of an attempted Traditionalist coup! It seems several disgruntled generals and nobles, with the backing of several prominent clergymen, attempted to seize Istaroth and proclaim the reinstatement of the old government. Fortunately, our people's faith in the Moderate government has greatly grown following our successes, and the Traditionalist's call to arms was barely heeded. Those involved in the attempted coup have swiftly been arrested and are now facing judgement."
 ord.26.a:0 "We shall not go back to the genocidal insanity of the past!"
 ord.27.t:0 "Traditionalist Coup Succeeds!"
 ord.27.d:0 "People across the country rejoice as several righteous generals and nobles, with the backing of the holy Church, have successfully arrested the Moderate government and reinstated Traditionalist rule today. The blundering of the Moderates has caused great discontent amongst the populace, and they are happy to see a competent government restored. A great day for Ordoria!"

 ord.28.d:0 "Our nation is reeling from an attempted Traditionalist coup! This morning, an army of disgruntled soldiers and nobles, backed by a good portion of the Church, marched on Istaroth, seizing the capital and proclaiming the reinstatement of the old government! However, a good portion of the land, including the city of Varinthia, has openly condemned this coup and is rallying to drive the Traditionalists out. It seems a civil war is unavoidable!"
 ord.28.a:0 "A fine excuse to rid ourselves of the Traditionalist scum!"
 ord.28.b:0 "Rid our people of this Moderate insanity!"
 ord.29.t:0 "Eastern Ordoria Reclaimed!"
 ord.29.d:0 "After a gruelling campaign through the jungles of the East, we have finally brought the rebels to their knees! Quellion is ours, and the rebels' leaders are being rounded up and executed wherever we can find them. We must now decide what to do with our lands."
 ord.29.a:0 "We cannot allow them even a sliver of autonomy - integrate them!"
 ord.29.b:0 "If we give them a taste of freedom, it will keep them complacent - set up a vassal state!"
 ord.30.t:0 "Skaelinger Offers Peace"
 ord.30.d:0 "It seems the direness of their position has finally seeped through the thick skulls of the Dwarves - their diplomats formally offered peace today. What should our response be?"
 ord.30.a:0 "We've taught them their lesson - we have bigger fish to fry."
 ord.30.b:0 "Peace suits us, but they must accept some border adjustments."
 ord.30.c:0 "Peace?! We shall give them the peace of the grave!"
 ord.30.e:0 "If they swear fealty to the Ordorian Crown, they shall have their peace."
 ord.33.t:0 "Concessions - Skaelinger Accepts"
 ord.33.d:0 "Good news! Skaelinger accepts our proposed border changes - they have vacated the designated mountain ranges and passes, and our engineers are already en route to fortify these crucial strategic positions - our Eastern flank shall evermore be secure!"
 ord.33.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ord.32.t:0 "Concessions - Skaelinger Declines!"
 ord.32.d:0 "Despite their desperate situation, it seems the Dwarves are as stubborn as ever - they have refused our demands!"
 ord.32.a:0 "Their mistake."
 ord.33.t:0 "Vassalage - Skaelinger Accepts"
 ord.33.d:0 "It seems enough brute force can break even a Dwarf's will - the High King of Skaelinger has agreed to bend the knee as our vassal!"
 ord.33.a:0 "They have seen reason."
 ord.34.t:0 "Vassalage - Skaelinger Refuses"
 ord.34.d:0 "Dwarven stupidity knows no bounds - despite their impossible situation, Skaelinger refuses to swear fealty to us!"
 ord.34.a:0 "Their mistake."
 ord.35.t:0 "Punish Stahlhof"

 ord.36.t:0 "Stahlhof Accepts!"
 ord.36.d:0 "Great news! Stahlhof has accepted our proposal, and though they will maintain a masquerade of loyalty for now, they will join us when the time is right."

 ord.37.t:0 "Stahlhof Rejects!"
 ord.37.d:0 "Those damned Stahlhoffers have the guts to reject our generous offer! We will have to proceed without their support."
 ord.37.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.38.t:0 "The Stahlhof Gambit"
 ord.38.d:0 "While the men of Stahlhof have been enroaching on our territory for decades and the ambition of their Freiprinz knows no bounds, perhaps this ambition can be turned to our cause. Rumor has it that Schwarzenbach's attacks on our lands are a mere ruse, allowing him to build up an army under the pretense of fighting us while in reality planning to seize the Freithron. Several of our advisors have now proposed a deal: Stahlhof returns our lands, and they get to rule the Union - under our benevolent guidance, of course."
 ord.38.a:0 "I do love an ironic plot twist..."

 ord.39.t:0 "Rthaur Resistance!"
 ord.39.d:0 "Though we have conquered the lands of the Rthaur rebels, they have not been cured of their foolish ideas. Apparently, they are building an underground network in our country, seeking to launch our nation into another civil war! If we do not integrate the rebel's lands quickly, we may yet lose all that we have gained!"
 ord.39.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.40.t:0 "Second Rthaur Revolution!"
 ord.40.d:0 "Though the wise among our advisors warned us of the dangers of the rebels' resistance, we did not heed their advice in time. The rebel's ideology has spread through our nation like a cancer, and they have risen up in open revolt, even stronger than the last time!"

 ord.41.b:0 "The local Grove Guards will handle it."
 ord.42.t:0 "Slave Leader Emerges"
 ord.42.d:0 "It appears that local law enforcement has been unable to shatter the rebellious vermin quickly enough. A leader has emerged from amongst them, and the unorganised mass of vermin has turned into a guerillia army inside our own borders."
 ord.42.a:0 "Local law enforcement will have to try harder."
 ord.42.b:0 "Send in the army!"
 ord.43.t:0 "Revolt Crushed"
 ord.43.d:0 "The slave revolt is crushed! The heads of the ringleaders now stand on spikes in front of the slave's encampment, serving as a reminder to the vermin to know their place. Their spirit seems to have been broken."
 ord.43.a:0 "Back to business as usual."
 ord.44.t:0 "Traditionalist Riot!"
 ord.44.d:0 "It seems our tolerance of the demi-Elves in our country has angered the sympathisers of the Traditionalist factio, who are now rioting in the streets, attacking demi-Elven passersby and vandalizing propert!"
 ord.44.a:0 "I'm sure those demi-Elves started it!"
 ord.44.b:0 "Unacceptable - send in law enforcement!"
 ord.45.t:0 "Law Enforcement Joins Rioters!"
 ord.45.d:0 "It seems our guards are not exempt from racial prejudices - instead of stopping the riots, they are joining them! Demi-Elven businesses are being robbed and set on fire, and those demi-Elves that resist are beaten and jailed."
 ord.45.a:0 "Pull in law enforcement from other cities!"
 ord.45.b:0 "That's it - send in the troops!"
 ord.46.t:0 "Traditionalists Subdued!"
 ord.46.d:0 "Our actions have had their desired effects - the Traditionalist rioters have been subdued, and the day-to-day order of business has been restored!"
 ord.46.a:0 "Let's hope the economic damage was limited."
 ord.47.t:0 "Nobles Protest Austerity"
 ord.47.d:0 "A delegation of nobles has petitioned the government today, complaining about the austerity measures we have passed. They claim that it is their right to enjoy themselves as they see fit - how should we respond?"
 ord.47.a:0 "If they insist... let them eat cake!"
 ord.47.b:0 "They will change their tune once the Inquisition pays a visit to their homes."
 ord.48.t:0 "Nobles Attempt Coup!"
 ord.48.d:0 "Our attempt at strongarming the nobility has failed, and they have tried to seize power today! Though their attempt was pitiful, only securing them parts of the city of "

 ord.48.b:0 "That's it! Send in the army."
 ord.49.t:0 "Coup Halted"
 ord.49.d:0 "The nobility's attempted coup has been crushed, the possessions of the rebellious and probably heretical traitors sold off to found a new temple in Ythelmare. Stability has been restored."
 ord.49.a:0 "Our plans advance."
 ord.50.t:0 "The Hofmeyer Question"
 ord.50.d:0 "Adalbrecht Hofmeyer, one of the Humans in our realm, has proven to be an incredibly competent administrator. He has risen far in the ranks of the government, being the personal aide of the recently-passed Governor of Ythelmare, and is now requesting we appoint him as the new Governor!"
 ord.50.a:0 "We must not waste potential, no matter its origin. Hofmeyer shall rule Ythelmare!"
 ord.50.b:0 "Never! The demi-Elves must know their place and be glad they are granted it!"
 ord.51.t:0 "Trial of the Five"
 ord.51.d:0 "Treason against the state in the highest circles of government! Several young nobles, including son of the King and heir to the throne Larennis Valinthir, have been discovered hiding vermin from the authorities! The Traditionalists demand the death penalty, but the King is pulling all the strings he can to save his son. What shall their fate be?"
 ord.51.a:0 "Larennis Valinthir and his compatriots are acquitted!"
 ord.51.b:0 "Larennis Valinthir and his compatriots are found guilty!"
 ord.52.t:0 "The Resderin Conclave"
 ord.52.d:0 "Religious officials from across the country have gathered today to discuss a matter that has almost split the Church in twain: should the Moderate faction, which advocates co-existence with the vermin in a segregated society, be declared heretical and an affront to our Holy Church?"
 ord.52.a:0 "The Moderates spit on the holy Elven image - they are heretics!"
 ord.52.b:0 "They are still elves - the Moderates are not heretical!"
 ord.53.t:0 "Succesful Raid!"

 ord.53.a:0 "To the victor go the spoils!"
 ord.54.t:0 "The Rebellion Crushed Once More!"
 ord.54.d:0 "The Second Rthaur Revolution ended the same way the first did - humiliating defeat for the rebels. Their ringleaders have been dragged into Quellion's central square and were all beheaded in a display of Ordorian might. There are a few guerillia cells left in the jungles, but they will all be found and put to the sword in time."
 ord.54.a:0 "Final victory over the rebels is ours!"
 ord.55.t:0 "Hysbryn on the Move!"
 ord.55.d:0 "It seems the Humans of Hysbryn, or 'Holzbrenn' in their barbaric tongue, have designs on our lands! Our spies have reported that their armies are exercising for an invasion of our South-Western territories, with the goal of driving us from Tholder Bay!"
 ord.55.a:0 "First Schwarzenbach, and now this? Alert the troops!"
 ord.56.t:0 "Moderate Victory!"
 ord.56.d:0 "The civil war has been brutal and harsh on our people, but we stand triumphant, the purple flag of King Valinthir flown high over Istaroth once more. The King himself and his son and heir to the throne, Laurennis Valinthir, led the final assault on the last Puritan stronghold. The Traditionalist resistance has been shattered, and Lothinnys has been tried and executed as a traitor. The authority of the Moderates now stands unquestioned."
 ord.56.a:0 "Glory to King Valinthir!"
 ord.57.t:0 "Traditionalist Victory!"
 ord.57.d:0 "The civil war has been brutal and harsh on our people, but total victory over the Moderates and their sickening tolerance of the vermin has been assured as last. The King was placed under house arrest after trying to flee aboard a ship from Ythelmare, but his son, Laurennis, is still unaccounted for. Regardless, Traditionalist authority has been restored in Ordoria."
 ord.57.a:0 "Down with the lesser races and their Moderate cronies!"
 ord.58.t:0 "The Future of Ordoria"
 ord.58.d:0 "With the Moderate threat quashed, the old squabbles between the Traditionalists and the Faithful have flared up again. While they agree on the end goal of Elven supremacy, they are still in disgreement on how to achieve this goal. An impromptu meeting has been called in Istaroth to decide the course Ordorian politics should take."
 ord.58.a:0 "We shall lead Ordoria to glory and purity."

 ber.1.d:0 "We have been deepening our ties with our Southern neighbours for a while now, and this seems to have paid off in a huge way - the Union has officially announced their support for the Terugkeer, and they have promised to aid us when the time is ready to retake the Mountainhomes!"
 ber.1.a:0 "Wonderful news!"
 ska.1.t:0 "Ordoria Threatens Us!"
 ska.1.d:0 "An envoy from the Ordorians have arrived today, delivering a threat in no uncertain terms: either we renounce our alliance with Rthauiaur, or they will not stop until our Freehold is in ruins and the last family has been tossed off the cliffs."
 ska.1.a:0 "It is a difficult choice, but we cannot risk the destruction of our people."
 ska.1.b:0 "A plague on Istaroth! We stand with our friends, especially against such maniacs!"
 ska.2.t:0 "Ordoria Offers Peace"
 ska.2.d:0 "An Ordorian emissary appeared at our gate today, waving the white flag. It appears Ordoria would be content to end the fighting now, as they have retaken Rthauiaur. Though it would guarantee our safety, at least for the time being, it would also condemn our Rthaur allies to suffering under the Ordorian boot..."
 ska.2.a:0 "There is no dishonour in conceding defeat in a lost war. Agree to the peace."
 ska.2.b:0 "Never - we shall liberate Quellion and march right on to Istaroth!"
 ska.3.t:0 "Peace with Ordoria?"
 ska.3.d:0 "Our Rthaur allies have fallen and our proud capital is in the hands of the Ordorians. Reports of atrocities and the destruction of ancient works of art and holy relics are already filing in from refugees - perhaps we should bend the knee to Ordoria and concede defeat?"
 ska.3.a:0 "We must swallow our pride and admit defeat."
 ska.3.b:0 "Stomp out these defeatist thoughts!"
 ska.4.t:0 "Ordoria Accepts!"
 ska.4.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned, bearing good news - Ordoria has accepted our offer of peace! Yet, this news is received with little warmth at court - we might have peace, but our people still lay massacred, our buildings destroyed and the tombs of our ancestors desecrated."
 ska.4.a:0 "Vae victis."
 ska.5.t:0 "Ordoria Demands Concessions"
 ska.5.d:0 "Ordoria's diplomats have made clear that they are willing to end the war if we accept some border adjustments. It seems Ordoria wants to put some mountains between them and our vengeance."
 ska.5.a:0 "It is this peace or the peace of the grave."
 ska.5.b:0 "A true Dwarf will die before losing their honour! We will fight to the end!"
 ska.6.t:0 "Ordoria Declines!"
 ska.6.d:0 "The grim mood at court grew even gloomier when our haggard diplomats walked in. Their sorrowful eyes betrayed the message they had before they said a word - Ordoria has rejected our offer of peace."
 ska.6.a:0 "A fight to the end it is, then."
 ska.7.t:0 "Ordoria Demands Vassalage!"
 ska.7.d:0 "Ordoria's diplomats have offered us peace, but at the cost of our sovereignty - they demand we submit as a vassal state!"
 ska.7.a:0 "At least they're just imperialists now, instead of genocidal maniacs..."
 ska.7.b:0 "Dwarves, bowing to an Elf? Never!"
 ska.8.t:0 "The Second Rthaur Revolution"
 ska.8.d:0 "It seems the Ordorians could break the armies of our allies, but not their spirit. Across Ordorian territory, Rosites are rising up in what is called the 'Second Rthaur Revolution'. An envoy of these revolutionaries has come to our court today, imploring us to aid their cause once more."
 ska.8.a:0 "A Dwarf never forgets a friend - Rthauiaur calls for aid, and Skaelinger shall answer!"
 ska.8.b:0 "We wish them the best, but another war would spell doom for us. They are on their own."
 ska.8.c:0 "It is tragic, but our obligations to our liege prevent us from helping."
 ska.9.t:0 "Rthauiaur Falls!"
 ska.9.d:0 "Our allies in Rthauiaur have fallen to the Ordorian ontslaught! Our troops have scattered into the jungles and made their way home to reconsolidate and defend our mountain halls!"
 ska.9.a:0 "Fall back and defend, enemy coming!"
 ska.10.t:0 "The Union Sends Aid!"
 ska.10.d:0 "Good news from an unexpected corner - a sizable regiment of well-armed soldiers from the Union of Free Ungerdaler Princes has arrived! Although the situation was initially tense, with the captain of the guard of Skaelinger demanding the disarmament and dispersal of the troops, it was soon made clear they were here on direct orders of the Hochprinzessin to aid us in retaking our homelands! They are sure to provide a crucial boon to our troops."
 ska.10.a:0 "It is good that they remember old alliances."
 ska.11.t:0 "The Union Offers Aid!"
 ska.11.d:0 "We have been deepening our ties with our Southern neighbours for a while now, and this seems to have paid off in a huge way - the Union has officially announced their support for the Seventh Campaign, and they have promised to aid us when the time is ready to retake the Mountainhomes!"
 ska.11.a:0 "Wonderful news!"
 ska.12.t:0 "Attend the Nordtorf Summit?"
 ska.12.d:0 "The Union of Free Ungerdaler Princes has been involving itself more and more in Dwarven politics, and all of that meddling seems to have come to a climax. High-ranking diplomats from Faustburg have arrived, inviting our King to personally attend a meeting with the King of Skaelinger, in order to settle our differences once and for all. Should we attend?"
 ska.12.a:0 "Could we really find common ground? After so long?"
 ska.12.b:0 "There shall be no negotiations with those Rimatan bastards!"
 ska.13.t:0 "The Union Backs Us!"
 ska.13.d:0 "Good news! Thanks to our King's impassioned plea, Adalina has wisely sided with us in the Nordtorf Summit! She has spoken out in favour of Dwarven unity. As soon as she finished speaking, the Skaelingers in attendance - except for our dignified King, of course - broke out in raucous cheers, and the Rimatan delegation asked for a recess to discuss these developments."
 ska.13.a:0 "Let us hope Rimatü sees reason."
 ska.14.t:0 "The Union Backs Skyldske!"
 ska.14.d:0 "Despite our King's fiery speech in favour of Skaelinger's rightful claims, Adalina has not been swayed. She has viciously backed Rimatü and the rebel Skyldske in their ludicrous claims to our territories! Yet, at the same time, this centuries-long hostility has brought great harm to our people...\nWhat should we do?"
 ska.14.a:0 "Perhaps, for the sake of peace, we must agree."
 ska.14.b:0 "Concede to the Rimatan secessionists? Never!"
 ska.17.t:0 "The Union Marches to War!"
 ska.17.d:0 "Following the breakdown of negotiations, the Union has decided to march to war to aid our side. We can join them, once we are ready."
 ska.17.a:0 "Excellent!"
 rth.1.t:0 "Ordorian Influence"
 rth.1.d:0 "Our inability to properly patrol our borders is hurting our cause severely, as it appears that Ordoria is sending over warriors, equipment and propaganda to assist sympathisers to their despicable cause in preparing for a coup against the government! We must aim to secure our borders and root out these cells, lest they send our country into another destructive civil war!"
 rth.1.a:0 "Damn them!"
 rth.2.t:0 "Pro-Ordorian Coup!"
 rth.2.d:0 "Our worst fears have come true today - across the sympathisers, Ordoria's sympathisers are rising up in arms to overthrow our rightful government! Fortunately, it appears that many of our loyal citizens have taken what arms they can find and risen to defend the revolution, but the situation looks dire indeed..."
 rth.2.a:0 "For the sake of our people, we must not lose this war!"
 rth.2.b:0 "At long last, we can cast off the shackles of the xeno-lovers!"
 rth.3.t:0 "Skaelinger Abandons Us!"
 rth.3.d:0 "A message from the Free Stronghold arrived, looking rather downtrodden, even ashamed. We soon found out why. Under Ordorian pressure, our 'steadfast' allies in the mountains have rescinded their protection of us - we will have to face the Ordorian onslaught alone!"
 rth.3.a:0 "Damn those Dwarves!"
 rth.4.t:0 "War with Ordoria!"
 rth.4.d:0 "Whether we are ready or not, the civil war has flared up to full-scale war once more. The fate of our people will be decided at last."
 rth.4.a:0 "To arms!"
 rth.5.t:0 "The Revolution Triumphant!"
 rth.5.d:0 "Though they tried and tried again, the genocidal despots in Ordoria could not break our people's indomitable spirit! Our brave soldiers have shattered the Ordorian troops, and the Bread-and-Rose Banner now flies from the keep of Istaroth!"
 rth.5.a:0 "The people victorious, now and forever more!"
 rth.6.t:0 "Loris Pass Lost!"
 rth.6.d:0 "The Loris Pass, the only easily traversable route between Quellion and Thurgithon, has been lost to the enemy! This is a major setback, as our military communications are disrupted and our country is split in two halves."
 rth.6.a:0 "Damnation!"
 rth.7.t:0 "Loris Pass Regained"
 rth.7.d:0 "We have retaken the Loris pass, and held against the enemy's counter-attack! Military communications are back to normal, though civilian travel is, obviously, still limited."
 rth.7.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 rth.8.t:0 "Loris Pass Unnecessary"
 rth.8.d:0 "A trickle of survivors have crossed into the half of our country we still control, through the mountains or through enemy lines. All share the same message; the other half of our country has fallen. At least we don't have to worry about communication issues anymore..."
 rth.8.a:0 "That's... good?"
 rth.9.t:0 "Alucien Found Dead!"
 rth.9.d:0 "Terrible news has struck our nation today. When the secretaries of state sent a messenger to Derathur's house, inquiring why he was late to today's meeting, he was found brutally murdered in his bed! The Burning Tree of Ordoria was branded into his forehead. The new Prime Speaker has already been sworn in, but the nation is in deep mourning."
 rth.9.a:0 "A dark day for our nation."
 rth.10.t:0 "Alucien Murdered!"
 rth.10.d:0 "The vile Ordorians have killed Alucien Derathur, the Hero of the Revolution, in his bed, like the cowards they are! Rthaur workers throughout the nation are crying out for blood, and people are signing up for the army in droves!"
 rth.10.a:0 "We must wipe these barbaric murderers from the face of the planet!"
 rth.11.t:0 "Skaelinger Joins Us!"
 rth.11.d:0 "It was wise to call upon our historical allies - Skaelinger has reaffirmed the bond our nation shares, and has agreed to take up arms against the evil of Ordoria alongside us for a second time!"
 rth.11.a:0 "Once more into the breach!"
 rth.12.t:0 "Skaelinger Refuses to Join Us"
 rth.12.d:0 "Though we had hoped Skaelinger would be willing to fight alongside us once more, our messenger came back with ill news today - Skaelinger won't join us! They're still devastated from the last war, and fear another might spell their extinction."
 rth.12.a:0 "It appears we're on our own this time."
 rth.13.t:0 "Skaelinger Cannot Join Us"
 rth.13.d:0 "Though we had hoped Skaelinger could take up arms alongside us yet again, our envoy has returned empty-handed; citing responsibilities to their overlords, Skaelinger informed us they can sadly not join our war."
 rth.13.a:0 "First we destroy Ordoria, then we liberate our comrades!"
 rth.14.t:0 "The Union Offers Aid"
 rth.14.d:0 "The humans of Anthygynaur, or 'the Ungerdaler Union' as they call themselves, have come to us with a proposal for Ordorian containment. Though they uphold oppressive feudal principles, can we really afford to turn their aid down?"
 rth.14.a:0 "Ordoria is a threat orders of magnitude greater than any petty Human tyrant. We must accept."
 rth.14.b:0 "Death before dishonour!"
 rth.15.t:0 "The Pact Comes to An End"
 rth.15.d:0 "After the defeat of the Ordorians, it is clear to our people that we can no longer continue working with the Humans of Anthygynaur and their monarchist ways. We shall inform them of the end to our makeshift alliance."
 rth.15.a:0 "The Puritans were first. The Monarchists are next."
 rth.16.t:0 "Aid from the Union"
 rth.16.d:0 "The Provisional Government was surprised to find a procession of Anthygyne officers and weapons caches marching down the streets of Quellion this morning. Having travelled through Skaelinger, they have arrived here to offer us weapons and training to fight Ordoria, no strings attached."
 rth.16.a:0 "The Ordorians shall find us well-prepared."
 rth.17.t:0 "The Union Offers Conditional Aid"
 rth.17.d:0 "The Union has reached out with a difficult proposal today. They are offering to train our officers and smuggle us shipments of weapons, both of which we desperately need, but they demand that we give influential government positions to members of aristocratic anti-Ordorian factions. This would greatly influence our government's founding principles and future policy, but the alternative might be a lack of existence at all in the near future."
 rth.17.a:0 "We shall never betray the Revolution!"
 rth.17.b:0 "Defeating the Ordorians is more important than ideological purity."
 gmr.1.t:0 "Ordorian Overtures"
 gmr.1.d:0 "Our border guards were taken by surprise this morning as an Ordorian delegation came riding out of the jungles, waving the white flag. Apparently, there's been a rather radical shift in attitude in Ordoria's government, and we are now being approached with a proposal: if we pledge to assist Ordoria in putting down the Rthaur rebellion, they are willing to sign a pact of non-aggression with us. What should we do?"
 gmr.1.a:0 "Securing our Southern border would free up troops for our Rimatü campaign - sign the pact!"
 gmr.1.b:0 "Around Elves, watch yourselves - there shall be no such treaty!"
 gmr.2.t:0 "Ordoria Formalizes the Pact"
 gmr.2.d:0 "An envoy from our friends to the South has arrived - they have worked out the final details, and they are ready to formalize our alliance. We have been invited to send a delegation to the port city of Ythelmare to finalize the creation of the pact."
 gmr.2.a:0 "Excellent! Send our most respected diplomats to Ythelmare!"
 gmr.3.t:0 "Ordoria Breaks the Pact"
 gmr.3.d:0 "Citing the defeat of the Rthaur rebellion, the Ordorians have informed us that our alliance has 'outlived its usefulness'. Ordoria considers all treaties between us null and void, and scouts have reported Ordorian troop movements at our border!"
 gmr.3.a:0 "Damn those treacherous Elves!"
 gmr.4.t:0 "Ordoria Seizes Sothane!"
 gmr.4.d:0 "Word has reached us that Ordorian troops have swiftly marched on the small Duchy of Sothane, taking the soldiers there by complete surprise! Sothane is now firmly under Ordorian control..."
 gmr.4.a:0 "Assemble the generals - this means war!"
 gmr.4.b:0 "We must back down for now."
 gmr.5.t:0 "Arthenon Assassinated!"
 gmr.5.d:0 "Terrible news! The Grand Master has been assassinated by an outlaw Noctheurge today. The military has stepped in to maintain order, but the situation is dire..."
 gmr.5.a:0 "Sing of his final stand, long live Trabaster..."
 gmr.6.t:0 "The Realm Shatters!"
 gmr.6.d:0 "The death of the Grand Master, the takeover by the Kingsmen Rebels and now Jace's coup has proven too much to handle for the Realm - the country has shattered, with the natives in every major city driving out the nobility that landed with Arthenon and declaring independence!"
 gmr.6.a:0 "Ierethayne, first nation to fall to the Tyrant, will be the first freed!"
 gmr.6.b:0 "Felweyne, heart of the inland trade of the Northern Plains, will rise once more!"
 gmr.6.c:0 "Kortinall, city of woodworkers, is free at last!"
 gmr.6.e:0 "No, we shall lead another nation..."
 gmr.7.t:0 "Ordorian Raids"
 gmr.7.d:0 "It seems Ordoria is on the move - the village of Dorissus has been put to the torch! Though not many people died, it will take a while to repair the damage..."
 gmr.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
 gmr.8.t:0 "Noble Assassinated!"
 gmr.8.d:0 "The royal court was in shock today, as word reached us a prominent local noble has been assassinated! All signs point to this being the work of Ordoria."
 gmr.8.a:0 "Tragic."

 gmr.9.d:0 "People out late at night are found the next morning as horribly mutilated corpses, children are stolen from their beds, and tortured shrieks can be heard throughout the night. All signs point to Ordoria being behind this."
 gmr.9.a:0 "Double the watch! Nay, triple it!"
 gmr.10.t:0 "Ordorian Meddling"
 gmr.10.d:0 "A disturbing pattern of assassinations, riots and blackmail has come to our attention as of late. It appears that there is a conspiracy in the works with the goal of shattering our Union! All signs point to Ordoria..."
 gmr.10.a:0 "Damn those Elves!"
 gmr.11.t:0 "Separatist Uprisings!"
 gmr.11.d:0 "Funded by foreign groups - all traces leading back to the Ordorians - separatist movements across the nation have risen up! They are well-organized, and if not quickly stopped could bring the entire Realm come crashing down!"
 gmr.11.a:0 "Do everything in our power to stop the separatists!"
 gmr.12.t:0 "Irenthar Remains Loyal"
 gmr.12.d:0 "Though even the capital had to deal with some uprisings, the city's status as capital meant that any such revolt was doomed from the start. Arthenon himself led the charge against the last separatist stronghold, and the heads of the movement's leaders now jut from spikes in front of the gates of the city."
 gmr.12.a:0 "We hold Irenthar. This means not everything is lost."
 gmr.13.t:0 "Irenthar Revolts!"
 gmr.13.d:0 "The separatists have made gains beyond their wildest dreams - Irenthar itself has fallen to the rebels! Arthenon has fled the city, and the Blacksteel Throne has been paraded through the city before being tossed into the harbour. The situation is dire."
 gmr.13.a:0 "We built the city too well - we cannot take it by storm. We must regroup and prepare for siege."
 gmr.13.b:0 "If the capital falls, all is lost - send all available men to retake Irenthar!"
 gmr.14.t:0 "Felwerin Remains Loyal"
 gmr.14.d:0 "Good news! We have received reports from the Enforcers of Felwerin that they have quelled the uprising there. Martial law has been declared, and the city stands ready to aid us in defeating the uprisings!"
 gmr.14.a:0 "The heart of the Northern Plains remains in our hands."
 gmr.15.t:0 "Felwerin Revolts!"
 gmr.15.d:0 "At dawn, a single horseman rode into the city, slumped on his horse with an arrow in his shoulder. It was one of Felwerin's Enforcers, having ridden non-stop for three nights and three days to bring us word that the city has fallen to separatists!"
 gmr.15.a:0 "Regrettable, but the open plains of Felwerin would have been impossible to hold anyway."
 gmr.15.b:0 "Felwerin is the key to controlling the Plains - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.16.t:0 "Cortineal Remains Loyal"
 gmr.16.d:0 "The Enforcers in our city of Cortineal have sent word that they have beaten down all separatist movements in the city! Some isolated rebels remain in the thick woodlands surrounding the city, but they should not prove any threat to our control of the region."
 gmr.16.a:0 "Our Southern border is secure!"
 gmr.17.t:0 "Cortineal Revolts!"
 gmr.17.d:0 "Terrible news! After a sustained campaign of guerillia warfare from both the woodlands in the countryside and the slums in the city, Cortineal has fallen to the separatists!"
 gmr.17.a:0 "That is a disappointment, but we cannot do anything right now."
 gmr.17.b:0 "We cannot lose their timber supplies - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.18.t:0 "Nastrogdar Remains Loyal"
 gmr.18.d:0 "The Enforcers in Nastrogdar have beaten down a peasant's uprising, and the city stands ready to defend the Realm!"
 gmr.18.a:0 "We won't have to worry about our food supplies, then!"
 gmr.19.t:0 "Nastrogdar Revolts!"
 gmr.19.d:0 "Nastrogdar has fallen to a peasant rebellion! The serfs have put the many aristocratic manors in the countryside to the torch and taken control of the city!"
 gmr.19.a:0 "They're too far away from our secured territory. We'll have to pacify them later."
 gmr.19.b:0 "We msut secure our food supply - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.20.t:0 "Caltireth Remains Loyal"
 gmr.20.d:0 "We have received word that Caltireth's loyalty has not wavered! There were some scuffles in the foundries and the mines, but the nobility's troops have put these all down."
 gmr.20.a:0 "Looks like we'll have all the equipment we need to put down these uprisings."
 gmr.21.t:0 "Caltireth Revolts!"
 gmr.21.d:0 "Ill tidings from the East today - Caltireth has declared independence! The nobility has cited the lack of stability in the Realm as the reasaon, proclaiming that we have failed in our obligation to defend them and as such all feudal ties are dissolved."
 gmr.21.a:0 "Without me, those ungrateful bastards would have been rotting away in Eokgi slave ships!"
 gmr.21.b:0 "We must secure the smithies of Kaltire - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.22.t:0 "Trifersi Remains Loyal"
 gmr.22.d:0 "Many in our government feared that Trifersi, ever a hub of rebels and other scum, would fall to the separatists, but it seems the local Enforcers acted swiftly to calm the situation down. Martial law has been declared and the gallows are rich with traitor corpses."
 gmr.22.a:0 "Finally some good news for once..."
 gmr.23.t:0 "Trifersi Revolts!"
 gmr.23.d:0 "It seems we were not thorough enough with rooting out the Enstlas dynasty - a young man purporting to be the heir to the Last King has rallied the citizenry and driven out our forces!"
 gmr.23.a:0 "Gah! Do I have to commit every act of regicide myself?!"
 gmr.23.b:0 "Tell the Enforcers to go back in there and do their job properly this time."
 gmr.24.t:0 "Navandon Remains Loyal"
 gmr.24.d:0 "The Navy has proven to be worth its weight in gold today; our sailors have marched from their ships and put down the budding revolutionaries in Navandon!"
 gmr.24.a:0 "We must see the captains responsible get a pay rise."
 gmr.25.t:0 "Navandon Revolts!"
 gmr.25.d:0 "It seems we cannot trust our Navy - the sailors have defected to the separatists en mass, made their captains walk the plank, and declared independence as a Pirate Kingdom under a self-styled Admiral!"
 gmr.25.a:0 "This is purely a land battle. The Navy is of no concern for now."
 gmr.25.b:0 "Time to exploit the Army-Navy rivalry; send in the troops to put down this uprising!"
 gmr.26.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Irenthar"
 gmr.26.d:0 "It was a wise decision to send the Enforcers to retake the capital - Irenthar is once again ours! The Blacksteel Throne has been dredged from the ocean, and a reign of terror by the Enforcers is currently making sure the population never again considers stepping out of line."
 gmr.26.a:0 "The capital is safe. Now, to restore order in the rest of the Realm."
 gmr.27.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Irenthar"
 gmr.27.d:0 "Ill tidings - it turns out we made our capital too well-defended. The Enforcers have tried to take the city by storm, but the citizenry took to the walls and has repelled every attack. Without the numbers for a siege, the Enforcers returned to our current headquarters with heavy losses."
 gmr.27.a:0 "Damnation!"
 gmr.28.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Felwerin"
 gmr.28.d:0 "Our rapid response to the situation in Felwerin has borne fruit - the city is once again in our hands!"
 gmr.28.a:0 "The heartland of the Plains is secure once again."
 gmr.29.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Felwerin"
 gmr.29.d:0 "Sadly, our Enforcers have failed to take Felwerin by surprise. The remaining Enforcers in the city have been bribed by the separatists and are now unwilling to help us sneak into the city. We will have to abandon Felwerin for now."
 gmr.29.a:0 "We will return, and they will pay!"
 gmr.30.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Cortineal"
 gmr.30.d:0 "Excellent news - our Enforcers have retaken Cortineal! Already supplies of timber are flowing into the city again, replenishing our critically low stocks."
 gmr.30.a:0 "This should make the fletchers happy..."
 gmr.31.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Cortineal"
 gmr.31.d:0 "Our advance force has failed to retake Cortineal! This leaves our southern borders dangerously exposed to Ordorian advances..."

 gmr.33.t:0 "The Realm Shatters!"
 gmr.33.d:0 "Which country shall we lead?"
 gmr.33.a:0 "Trifell, last to fall, shall be the first to rise from the ashes!"
 gmr.33.b:0 "We shall not give up on the ambitions of the Grand Master!"
 gmr.33.c:0 "No, we must govern from another city."
 gmr.34.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Nastrogdar!"
 gmr.34.d:0 "The Enforcers we sent to pacify the farmers of Nastrogdar have been bled dry by a sustained campaign of harassment, and when they arrived at the city they were laughed off by the defenders. It seems our efforts to retake the Realm's breadbasket have failed."
 gmr.34.a:0 "Curses!"
 gmr.35.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Nastrogdar"
 gmr.35.d:0 "Our Enforcers have marched into Nastrogdar, fighting off the occasional group of disorganized farmers, and have retaken the city with little effort."
 gmr.35.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 gmr.36.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Caltireth"
 gmr.36.d:0 "Our armies have successfully retaken the foundries of Caltireth, and the rebellious nobles have surrendered. They are now locked in their own prisons!"
 gmr.36.a:0 "Our supply of arms is secured."
 gmr.37.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Caltireth"
 gmr.37.d:0 "The Caltiran nobility has unfortunately had the bright idea to arm their troops with the weapons and armour from their foundries. This has helped them beat back our troops!"
 gmr.37.a:0 "Damnation!"
 gmr.38.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Trifersi"
 gmr.38.d:0 "The Enforcers have finally done their job - the corpse of the last heir of the Enstlas Dynasty now hangs from the gates of the city, and the rebellion is broken at last!"
 gmr.38.a:0 "Good news!"
 gmr.39.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Trifersi"
 gmr.39.d:0 "The citizens of Trifersi continue to defy us - they have fought off the troops we sent in to quash the rebellion, and they now stand ready to march on our territory!"
 gmr.39.a:0 "Curses!"
 gmr.40.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Navandon"
 gmr.40.d:0 "The Navy has shown why it should stick to the seas - our troops have easily shattered their resistance and put down the rebellion!"
 gmr.40.a:0 "The generals responsible should be promoted!"
 gmr.41.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Navandon"
 gmr.41.d:0 "The rebellious sailors have beaten back our troops sent in to retake our rightful lands!"
 gmr.41.a:0 "I knew we should have just given them those oranges..."
 gmr.42.t:0 "Order Restored!"
 gmr.42.d:0 "The situation was dire, but we have presevered and put down every last separatist movement! The Black Gargoyle flies proudly from every major city on the Northern Plains once more!"
 gmr.42.a:0 "Glory to the Grand Master!"
 gmr.43.t:0 "The Kingsmen Rebellion"
 gmr.43.d:0 "Rumours of discontent and sedition are nothing new to the Enforcers, but unrest has reached a boiling point as of late. A young Half-Elven peasant from the farms of Nastrodoge claims he was told by the false gods of the native populace that he was destined to rule the Northern Plains, and he has been assembling an army of traitors for years. It seems that he finally felt ready to raise his banner in open revolt, and several cities have already fallen to his rebellion!"
 gmr.43.a:0 "Crush this upstart half-blood and wipe his army from the face of the planet!"
 gmr.43.b:0 "No longer shall the Northern Plains suffer under the tyranny of the Black Gargoyle!"
 gmr.44.t:0 "Dominance Restored!"
 gmr.44.d:0 "Victory is ours! Those foolish enough to question the will of the Grand Master have been beaten down, their little rebellion crushed. Arthenon is once more the undisputed lord of the Northern Plains!"

 gmr.46.t:0 "The Ungerdaler Union offers Pact"
 gmr.46.d:0 "Envoys from the Human realm to the South of Ordoria, the Ungerdaler Union, have arrived in Irenthar today. Meeting with the Juridity of Influence, they have argued that Ordoria is an existential threat to the both of us, and they have offered us an alliance. The matter has been deferred to Arthenon - what is the Grand Master's Judgement?"
 gmr.46.a:0 "The Black Gargoyle shall unite with the Cobalt Eagle - let the pact be made!"
 gmr.46.b:0 "We have better things to do than get involved with Ungerdaler politicking."
 gmr.47.t:0 "The Union Denounces Us!"
 gmr.47.d:0 "Shocking news from the Union - with the defeat of the Ordorians, the Union no longer considers our alliance beneficial, and they have informed us that it they consider the Twothrone Concord null and void! Their armies have already been spotted on our borders, and our advisors and observers have been ejected from their lands..."
 gmr.47.a:0 "Curse those damnable Southerners!"
 gmr.48.t:0 "The Jurditiy of Benevolence Declares for Arthenism"
 gmr.48.d:0 "Though for most of the duration of the Conquest, our generals-turned-nobility remained unified behind the Sothrist faith of our homeland, some were so awestruck by Arthenon's might that they began to whisper rumours of the Grand Master being more than human. Eventually, these seeds grew into a cult and then a fully-fledged, if fringe, religion. This religion has spread amongst the nobility, and even some of the natives. It has, in fact, grown so popular that the Juridity of Benevolence has openly declared itself Arthenist and is pushing for the faith to be made the state religion! This is doubtlessly a move by the High Juritor of Benevolence to increase his power, but we must nonetheless decide a course of action."
 gmr.48.a:0 "We will have to consider this development."
 gmr.49.t:0 "Religious Struggles"
 gmr.49.d:0 "With the recent declaration by the Juridity of Benevolence, religious tensions in our nation have come to a head. The nobility is now bitterly divided between the Sothrists and the Arthenists, and the local faith is more and more becoming the crux of the resistance movement. We need to decide what religion will guide the Realm before this schismatism undoes all we have fought for!"
 gmr.49.a:0 "Muzma and Dibegar would strike us down if we abandoned them!"
 gmr.49.b:0 "God-King, huh? I like the sound of that!"
 gmr.49.c:0 "Pragmatism must prevail - we must adopt the native religion!"
 gmr.50.t:0 "A Royal Proposal"
 gmr.50.d:0 "An envoy has arrived from the Ungerdaler Union, with the offer of uniting the houses of Vlussinger and Arthenon through marriage. We have a spare cousin or two lying around - what do we say?"

The banner of the Confederation now flies from the gates of Ierethayne, and the last of the Black Gargoyles have surrendered. Great celebrations are going on in the streets, but Astrellion and his most trusted advisors have already gathered to form a new government."

It seems he has assembled a gang of cronies from among the thugs of the Rebels, and is now attempting a coup d'etat by slaying Astrellion!"

Some argue in favour of Ierethayne for its formidable defenses, while others say that we should stay in Nastrodoge. Of course, the locals of every major city in the Confederation are clamouring for their city to be granted the honour of being the new capital."

It was finally settled when Krell declared that they were going to accept, then promptly beating down three challengers on the spot. Our diplomats claim it was quite impressive to behold."
 ung.18.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ung.19.t:0 "Perkavland Rejects!"
 ung.19.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned without success; Perkavland has rejected our generous offer, with our officials being laughed out of the room - Krell himself told our delegates that 'they have nothing to learn from some uppity, fat city-dwellers'. It is clear a diplomatic option is out of the question."
 ung.19.a:0 "This means war!"
 ung.19.b:0 "We have bigger concerns than some unwashed barbarians..."
 ung.20.t:0 "Proselytize in Perkavland?"
 ung.20.d:0 "Our diplomatic efforts in Perkavland have not gone unnoticed by the clergy. Today, we have been approached by Erzbischof Rosenstock of St. Vichtlas, who as requested permission to send a mission into the barbarian lands to the South. Should we allow Rosenstock to send his people to preach among the pagans?"
 ung.20.a:0 "Yes, we must spread the True Faith!"
 ung.20.b:0 "Let them keep their superstitions."
 ung.21.t:0 "Perkavland Allows Proselytizing"
 ung.21.d:0 "We have received word from Krell that our priests are allowed to spread the word of the Seven. We will soon have them weaned off of their foolish belief in but a single god."
 ung.21.a:0 "Praise the Seven!"
 ung.22.t:0 "Perkavland Declines Priests"
 ung.22.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems Rosenstock's mission has failed. Krell has - albeit respectfully, to his credit - declined the offer of preachers. It seems that Perkavland prefers to stay true to their old ways."
 ung.22.a:0 "It's their souls at stake, not ours."
 ung.23.t:0 "Krell Bends the Knee"
 ung.23.d:0 "Great news - Krell has accepted the Freithron, and is now on his way to Faustburg to swear fealty to the Hochprinzessin. Perkavland shall soon become a new Freiprinztum in the Unionn!"
 ung.23.a:0 "A victory for diplomacy!"
 ung.24.t:0 "Krell Declines"
 ung.24.d:0 "Sadly, it seems that Perkavland is adamant in its independence. They have refused to swear fealty, but they have agreed to a mutual defense treaty."
 ung.24.a:0 "At least our Southern border is secure."
 ung.25.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ung.25.d:0 "With the ascension of a new Hochprinzessin comes a chance to reinvigorate our position on the world stage. Where our predecessors took a somewhat isolationist stance to international relations, spending most of their time on internal affairs, Adalina is notable for her determination to turn the Union into a great power. Several of her advisors have pleaded for an aggressive, expansionist policy, while others advocate the use of soft power, using alliances and diplomacy to bring glory to the Union."
 ung.25.a:0 "The Bundesfahne shall fly over all of Latherin and Asweyne!"
 ung.25.b:0 "A network of alliances shall secure our rise to power."
 ung.26.t:0 "Tlarthingia Refuses!"
 ung.26.d:0 "An envoy from the Lizardmen has arrived today, letting us know that 'our fathers and mothers did not fight for an independent Tlarthingia only for us to give it away to another tyrant,' and that 'the proud people of Tlarthingia would never bend the knee' to the Hochprinzessin. While we could declare war on them in response, many within the Union would see this as a shockingly illegitimate act of statecraft, which would hurt our position greatly..."
 ung.26.a:0 "It is a shame they called our bluff."
 ung.26.b:0 "So be it! Let them know they are on their own."
 ung.26.c:0 "The Freiprinzen be damned, to arms!"
 ung.27.t:0 "Rthauiaur Accepts!"
 ung.27.d:0 "Our envoy returned from Quellion today, covered in sweat and with a couple nasty snake-bites, but with good news. After hours of tense deliberation between the various representatives of the villages and towns of the rebels, they have decided to stand with us against Ordoria!"
 ung.27.a:0 "Onwards, to Istaroth!"
 ung.28.t:0 "Rthauiaur Declines!"
 ung.28.d:0 "Our guards were met with a strange vision this morning - clad in simple brown peasant's garg, waving a red and gold banner imprinted with the bread and rose of the Rthaur rebellion, our envoy returned today, having clearly gone mad. Though most of what he says is heretical nonsense about 'peasant's rights' and 'strange women sitting on thrones raking in votes not being a basis for a system of government', he did tell us in no uncertain terms that the Rthaur had refused our request."
 ung.28.a:0 "That damn rabble has caused its own downfall! Oh, and throw that envoy in the oubliette."
 ung.29.t:0 "Rthauiaur Ends the Pact"
 ung.29.d:0 "After our victory over the Ordorians today, a representative of the Rthaur people informed our Hochprinzessin of the pact coming to an end. Though we have parted peacefully, we are under no illusions as to what they would do with our system of governance if given the chance."
 ung.29.a:0 "We must be vigilant."
 ung.30.t:0 "Lirothlind Accepts!"
 ung.30.d:0 "Our envoy has returned from the frozen lands of Lirothlind. The Elves of the North have let us know they are willing to stand with us against Arthenon."
 ung.30.a:0 "Excellent."
 ung.31.t:0 "Lirothlind Refuses."
 ung.31.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems that Lirothlind does not wish to stand with us against the Realm. They claim they do not wish to risk angering Arthenon."
 ung.31.a:0 "Too bad."
 ung.32.t:0 "Rimatü Accepts!"
 ung.32.d:0 "Our envoy has returned from the imposing mountains of Rimatü. The Dwarves of the North have let us know they are willing to stand with us against Arthenon."
 ung.32.a:0 "Excellent."
 ung.33.t:0 "Rimatü Refuses."
 ung.33.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems that Rimatü does not wish to stand with us against the Realm. They claim they do not wish to risk angering Arthenon."
 ung.33.a:0 "Too bad."
 ung.34.t:0 "Influx of Orodian Refugees"
 ung.34.d:0 "A trickle of Elves has been entering the Union ever since Lothinnys' coup, but the uprising in the East and subsequent paranoid crackdowns by the government have turned this into a flood. Though this is clearly a humanitarian crisis, some of our officials are concerned Ordorian spies may be among the refugees. What should we do?"
 ung.34.a:0 "We shall provide these victims of war and madness with whatever they need."
 ung.34.b:0 "We cannot afford to give Ordoria eyes throughout our nation."
 ung.35.t:0 "Tlarthingian Complacency"
 ung.35.d:0 "It appears that Tlarthingia has grown a little too confident in our protection. Reports from our observer missions and stationed troops claim that Tlarthingian military discipline has grown lax, relying on our reputation to keep the Irinthians at bay. This is clearly not an ideal situation - how should we respond?"
 ung.35.a:0 "We guaranteed warriors, not useless lizards. Remind the Tlarthingians of their obligations."
 ung.35.b:0 "Lax and not guarding their borders you say?"
 ung.36.t:0 "Reach Out to the Rthaur?"
 ung.36.d:0 "Citing the existential threat posed to our people by the Ordorian menace, several of our advisors have come forth with a drastic proposal - to ally ourselves with the Rthaur rebels. They might oppose our existence as nobility, they argue, but at least they don't oppose our existence as Humans. Should we commit to such an unthinkable alliance?"
 ung.36.a:0 "Rather them than the Ordorians!"
 ung.36.b:0 "The Rosites are exactly as dangerous as the Puritans!"
 ung.37.t:0 "Seeking Allies in the North"
 ung.37.d:0 "With the Ordorian threat dealt with, the Hochprinzessin and her advisors have been preparing for the next campaign, against Arthenon's Realm. It has become clear that we need an ally in the region if we are to emerge victorious. Our options are the Elves of Lirothlind, or the Dwarves of Rimatü. Given their well-documented loathing for each other, approaching one will inevitably alienate the other. Who should we make overtures to?"
 ung.37.a:0 "The narrow border of Lirothlind shall prove a most valuable defensive line!"
 ung.37.b:0 "The Fireforge weapons of Rimatü will cleave the Realm asunder!"
 ung.38.t:0 "Rthauiaur Rejects!"
 ung.38.d:0 "The Rthaur have categorically refused to grant any concessions to the nobility, forgoing our support."
 ung.38.a:0 "That is a shame."
 ung.39.t:0 "Rthauiaur Makes Concessions"
 ung.39.d:0 "Though they are not happy about it, the Rthaur government has accepted some noble blood in their government. Already the divine right to rule is being restored in some places in their land. Naturally, we have upheld our end of the bargain."
 ung.39.a:0 "Excellent."
 ung.40.t:0 "Stahlhof Requests Arms"
 ung.40.d:0 "Freiprinz Schwarzenbach has been skirmishing with the Ordorians on and off for years now, and to this end he has received men and material from Adalina on multiple occasions. He is once again asking for our material support, but rumour has it he is planning to stage a coup and attempt to seize the Prinzthron. Should we be arming a potential traitor?"
 ung.40.a:0 "Let him and Ordoria bleed each other dry."
 ung.40.b:0 "We cannot risk arming Stahlhof even more."
 ung.41.t:0 "Assisting the Revolution"
 ung.41.d:0 "The East of Ordoria has been in open revolt for several years now, and though the conflict has been quietly simmering for a while, it appears Ordoria is preparing for some aggressive moves. Our advisors are suggesting we assist the Rthaur in preparing for the inevitable Ordorian attack, but they are divided on whether or not that aid should come with any strings attached."
 ung.41.a:0 "We cannot risk the Rthaur declining and being crushed by Ordoria. Offer unconditional support."
 ung.41.b:0 "If they want our help, they'll have to play quid pro quo. Demand concessions for support."
 ung.42.t:0 "Arthenon Accepts Pact"
 ung.42.d:0 "Word from the Northern Plains - Arthenon is willing to stand with us against Ordoria! Our generals have met with the Grand Master's for a strategic planning session in Irenthar. Ordoria does not stand a chance against the two most powerful Human nations on Latherin united."
 ung.42.a:0 "The Freithron and the Blacksteel Throne stand united."
 ung.43.t:0 "Arthenon Rejects Pact"
 ung.43.d:0 "Sadly, Arthenon has expressed a lack of interest in forming a united front against the Ordorian menace. We stand alone against the Elves, and the Grand Master's Realm does, too."
 ung.43.a:0 "So be it."
 ung.44.t:0 "Risk of Civil War!"
 ung.44.d:0 "The Hochprinztum is not what it has been. Despite Adalina's best efforts, our realm's stability has been on the decline, and with rampant crime, corruption and general disregard for the laws of the land, many are now beginning to question the legitimacy of Adalina's rulership. This situation cannot be allowed to continue."
 ung.44.a:0 "This cannot be allowed to continue."
 ung.45.t:0 "Beginnings of Stabilization"
 ung.45.d:0 "It seems the worst of our period of instability is behind us. Adalina's leadership has rounded up the bandits, thieves and corrupt officials that have been plaging the land, and her rule is slowly becoming respected once more. We should never again let our country slide so far into chaos."
 ung.45.a:0 "The Seven save the Hochprinzessin!"
 ung.46.t:0 "The Anniversary Ball"
 ung.46.d:0 "After months of preparations, the Anniversary Ball is finally here! Guests from all over the Union have arrived, the drinks are flowing freely, and Adalina is talking to people left and right. After she'd given a well-received speech before the ball's start, she's been making good impressions on nobles, merchants and other dignitaries from across the land."
 ung.46.a:0 "A riveting success!"
 ung.47.t:0 "Noble's Plot Foiled!"
 ung.47.d:0 "Excellent news! The Royal Guard has reported no major problems in the arrests of those suspected of treachery - they were taken by complete surprise, and those few that put up a fight were quickly subdued. Adalina's reign is once again secured."
 ung.47.a:0 "For the glory of the Hochprinzessin!"
 ung.47.b:0 "The safety of Her Highness is paramount - make sure this can never happen again!"
 ung.48.t:0 "The Nobility Revolts!"
 ung.48.d:0 "Ill tidings - it appears that there was a spy among court, and the nobility was ready for those sent to arrest them! Our troops walked into a multitude of ambushes and traps, and most are arrested or slain. The nobility is now openly marching on the Faust!"
 ung.48.a:0 "Rally those of our troops that remain and prepare the defenses!"
 ung.49.t:0 "The Rebellion Crushed!"
 ung.49.d:0 "All seemed lost as traitor forces broke down the gates of the Faust, but at the eleventh hour, a young lieutenant from the Royal Guard, who had apparently rallied the surviving troops sent to the arrests, charged the rear of the foe! This threw the enemy in complete disarray, and Adalina herself led the countercharge from the defenders. The treasonous rebels have been scattered to the winds!"
 ung.49.a:0 "For the glory of the Hochprinzessin!"
 ung.49.b:0 "The safety of Her Highness is paramount - make sure this can never happen again!"
 ung.50.t:0 "The Rebels Victorious"
 ung.50.d:0 "With the initial forces sent to arrest the nobility shattered, the Faust was left without its most skilled defenders. When the nobility and their retinues marched on the castle, the writing was on the wall, and Adalina met the revolutionaries outside to surrender and save the city from bloodshed. She has been placed under house arrest, and though she is still nominally the Hochprinzessin, the nobility is well and truly in charge of Faustburg."
 ung.50.a:0 "Adalina's time is over. It is time for the adults to step in and take charge."
 ung.51.t:0 "Tlarthingia Agrees to Alliance!"
 ung.51.d:0 "The Tlarthingians have responded positively to our proposal for an alliance! Our generals are already exchanging intelligence and planning joint exercises."
 ung.51.a:0 "Wonderful."
 ung.52.t:0 "Tlarthingia Rejects Alliance!"
 ung.52.d:0 "The Tlarthingians have responded negatively to our proposal for an alliance. It seems we will have to find friends elsewhere."

 ung.57.a:0 "The Seven bless the happy couple!"
 ung.58.t:0 "Irinthios Declines!"

 ung.66.t:0 "The Nordtorf Summit"
 ung.66.d:0 "The Kings of Rimatü and Skaelinger have both arrived to discuss the hostility between their nations. Skyldske has cited Skaelinger's failure to protect the Vergall Empire from the Kurgur, as well as the unjust treatment of the Northern thaigs in general. Hellirfast pleaded Skaelinger's case with equal passion, citing abuses of power by Rimatan officials, historical dominion over Rimatü, and the unity of Dwarvenkind. The two remain at loggerheads, but our voice might just make a decision - what is our stance?"

Apparently, when the festivities wound down, she slipped away to her chambers with an unknown gentleman, despite being unwed. What's worse, Alko Blau, a minor Faustburger noble that fancies themselves a journalist saw this happen, and has published it in his Faustbürger Zeitung! Everyone in the Freiprinztum is talking about Adalina's dalliance!"

 ung.76.t:0 "Restless Nobility"
 ung.76.d:0 "After the Faustbürger Zeitung's coverage of Adalina's dalliance became widespread, our nobility has grown restless. They claim that Adalina is an embarrassment to the Freiprinztum and her 'reckless behaviour' is endangering our standing both in the Union and abroad. It seems they might prove a destabilizing factor in our domestic political sphere for the forseeable future."

Now, with her enemies politically outplayed and her position secure, she can finaly begin the laborious process of creating such a massive legal document. However, while she and the rest of the nobility would prefer to keep the process behind closed doors, influential middle-class citizens are calling for a popular constitution, with the citizens able to provide input on the exact contents.

Lafdaren is a strong proponent of strengthening the safeguards around magical research and clamping down on rogue magical activity, while Resmayer seeks to allow unfettered magical power and research free of constraints.

 hlz.2.d:0 "After the bloody suppression of the Carpenter's Strike, the Freiprinz ordered his men to arrest everyone with even the most tenous links to those involved. He then had everyone gathered up at the Altpalastplatz, under threat of death. The people's worst fears were realised when the Freiprinz announced the mass execution of everyone arrested!"

 hlz.3.t:0 "Rosenblut Deposed"
 hlz.3.d:0 "The bloodbath at the Altpalastplatz was the spark that set off the gunpowder barrel - the entire country has revolted against the Mad Prince! Even as the nobility is gathering their levies to march on the capital and place the Mad Prince under arrest, the people are out in the streets, armed with whatever they can find, co-ordinated by the Libertines and the Solidarity League. The city watch has defected to the rebels, and it is now only a question of who will be the first to oust the Freiprinz and secure power in Holzbrenn."
 hlz.3.a:0 "The nobility seizes the capital as Rosenblut flees with his tail between his legs!"
 hlz.3.b:0 "The citizenry breaks down the doors of the Altpalast and send Rosenblut packing!"
 hlz.4.t:0 "The Council of Dukes"
 hlz.4.d:0 "With order restored in the capital, the armies of the nobility are sent across the country to secure the other cities, fortresses and strategic positions. Meanwhile, all important nobles, primarily Dukes and Duchesses, have assembled in the Altpalast to discuss the future of the Freiprinztum."
 hlz.4.a:0 "The office of Freiprinz must hencheforth be constrained by checks and balances!"
 hlz.4.b:0 "We must never again allow a tyrant to govern Holzbrenn."
 hlz.5.t:0 "The Cherry Revolution"
 hlz.5.d:0 "The nobility's army at the gates has been brought to a screeching halt by a stout defense by the people of Holzbrenn, and after some diplomatic talks, the aristocracy has formally handed power to the new Citizen's Assembly. Emergency elections have been scheduled, but there are only two factions with a realistic chance of victory - the mercantile Libertines and the radical Solidarity League."
 hlz.5.a:0 "The Libertines' promises of freedoms sway the people!"
 hlz.5.b:0 "The Solidarity League's support for minorities and peasants carries the day!"
 hlz.6.t:0 "Resolving the Famine"
 hlz.6.d:0 "With domestic stability secured and the various noble houses assembled at the Edlerrat, discussion has turned to dealing with the famine sweeping the country. Some young aristocrats have set up soup kitchens to feed the poor and are requesting government support for this, but Beckenbauer and his supporters are arguing for the strict rationing of what food is available to make sure everyone can at least survive."
 hlz.6.a:0 "The Suppenküchen deserve our support!"
 hlz.6.b:0 "We must husband our resources carefully."
 hlz.7.t:0 "The Question of the University"
 hlz.7.d:0 "Now that the most immediate problems with the famine have been addressed, the Edlerrat has turned its attention to the University of Holzbrenn. Under Rosenblut, only the aristocracy was allowed to enter, and it was little more than a facility to indoctrinate the ruling class into the ideas of the Mad Freiprinz. There is broad agreement that the University should be opened to everyone, but the question is how far this should go."
 hlz.7.a:0 "The University should be open to all members of society!"
 hlz.7.b:0 "We must only allow the brightest minds to study at our University."
 hlz.8.t:0 "Housing our People"
 hlz.8.d:0 "Now that the tumultous weeks of Rosenblut's ousting are behind us, the government is turning its attention towards more mundane matters. A lack of acceptable housing has long been a problem in Holzbrenn, leading to slums in the city and homelessness everywhere. Many nobles have offered to repurpose their mansions for the benefit of the people, but Beckenbauer is arguing for a more thorough Renovation Program."
 hlz.8.a:0 "Initiate the Renovierungsprogramm!"
 hlz.8.b:0 "Let us repurpose the mansions instead."
 hlz.9.t:0 "Choosing our Friends"
 hlz.9.d:0 "With daily life returned to normal, voices in the Edlerrat have been calling for the expansion of the council to include non-royalty. They are concerned that we will lose legitimacy and public support if we do not reach out to the common folk of Holzbrenn. All are in agreement that the Elves require a representative to help undo the damages done to Elf-Human relation by Rosenblut, but there is a division between the majority, who want to invite the Libertines, and some young aristocrats who want to talk with the Solidarity League."
 hlz.9.a:0 "The Libertines, of course."
 hlz.9.b:0 "We must talk with the League!"
 hlz.10.t:0 "The Rebirth of a Nation"
 hlz.10.d:0 "Our country has gone through many radical changes in the past weeks, and many philosophers have gone so far as to call it 'The Rebirth of Holzbrenn'. This has become very clear in parliament, where it has become clear that there is some division as to what direction our nation should take. Though everyone is committed to the ideals of liberty and equality, the Libertines argue that we should pursue prosperity for our people, while the League argues that justice ought to take precedence."
 hlz.10.a:0 "Prosperity shall ensure a bright future for everyone in Holzbrenn!"
 hlz.10.b:0 "Let there be liberty and justice for all!"
 hlz.11.t:0 "Dealing with Ordoria"
 hlz.11.d:0 "The Elves to our North have grown increasingly bellicose in recent years, and the civil war that has broken out a few years ago seems to be flaring up again. We will need to respond in some manner, though the government is divided - the Libertines want to welcome refugees but otherwise stay out of it, while the League wants to send volunteers to join the Rthaur in their struggle."
 hlz.11.a:0 "Let Holzbrenn be a beacon of liberty for any oppressed Ordorian."
 hlz.11.b:0 "We must not let the dark tide of Puritanism overwhelm our Rthaur friends!"
 hlz.12.t:0 "Pressler's Ambitions"
 hlz.12.d:0 "Worrying news - it appears that one of Rosenblut's supporters, one Marius Pressler, is assembling an army and staking a claim to conquer Holzbrenn! Decrying the new government as 'illegitimate', he is arguing his case in various Freiprinztümer and using the wealth of his family to hire thugs and mercenaries in preparation of a coup!"
 hlz.12.a:0 "We must argue the righteous nature of our cause in front of Church and Hochprinzessin."
 hlz.12.b:0 "Words will get us nowhere - a more violent response is necessary."
 hlz.13.t:0 "The Future of the Legal System"
 hlz.13.d:0 "Under Rosenblut, the law was nothing more than a tool with which to dispose of those that opposed the state. This clearly has to change, but there is discussion over the best way to ensure justice. The aristocrats desire a system of 'Wessen Nachlass, sein Gesetz', where the local ruler resolves legal concerns, but Beckenbauer and his allies are pushing for a depoliticized legal system, with independent judges."
 hlz.13.a:0 "The Lords will surely pass wise judgement as needed."
 hlz.13.b:0 "And independent judiciary serves our people best."
 hlz.14.t:0 "The Question of Legitimacy"
 hlz.14.d:0 "We might have managed to secure short-term stability after ousting Rosenblut, but the aristocracy is still strongly associated with the Mad Freiprinz in the eyes of the common man. If we are to prevent another Republican uprising, we will have to shore up popular support somehow."
 hlz.14.a:0 "The Church enjoys the people's trust, we should approach them!"
 hlz.14.b:0 "Our people aren't stupid - we can convince them with sound arguments."
 hlz.14.c:0 "Actions speak louder than words. Strengthen the economy, and loyalty will follow."
 hlz.15.t:0 "The Bauernherren"
 hlz.15.d:0 "During Rosenblut's reign, many of our people fled or sadly perished, whether through the brutality of the Mad Freiprinz's cronies, or the famine he instigated. This has led to a lot of land being uncultivated. In recent months, however, some farmers have been buying up or otherwise acquiring this unused land, leading to creations of large farm-estates headed by a wealthy 'Bauernherr', or 'Gentleman Farmer'. They have been buying out neighbouring farms, meaning many one-time smallholders are now labourers on a Bauernherr-estate or have migrated to the cities in hopes of a better life. This shift in our economic situation must be at least investigated by the government to insure no unexpected consequences harm our still-fragile society."
 hlz.15.a:0 "We will have to consider our approach carefully."
 hlz.16.t:0 "Dealing with the Bauernherren"
 hlz.16.d:0 "After discussing the matter of the Bauernherren, three camps have formed; the League has mostly rallied behind Helmut Goeth, advocating for the rights of the 'smallholders', farmers whose lands are just about enough to support themselves and their families; the wealthier farmers in the Assembly are backing Alexandra von Neureim, a Bauernfrau herself, and finally, a majority of the Libertines is espousing the ideas of Joachim Fügler and his concept of 'machen-lassen', letting the mechanisms of the market sort out our agricultural situation."
 hlz.16.a:0 "Frau von Neureim is in the right."
 hlz.16.b:0 "Fügler's ideas will bring us wealth!"
 hlz.16.c:0 "Goeht's plan has merit!"
 hlz.17.t:0 "Land Reform"
 hlz.17.d:0 "One of our biggest campaigning points is land reform; some people own enough land to support an entire village, while others have nothing but the clothes on their backs, forced to work for a pittance to stay alive. Everyone in the League agrees that this situation cannot stand, but we are divided in how to go about land redistribution. One of the League's most prominent organizers, Karl Stelzner, is pushing for state-owned farms, while Frau Katzmann, our spokesperson, advocates restricting the possession of land to smallholds. Finally, a Rthaur refugeed by the name of Ylcatra Isthyne advocates following the Rthaur model of communal farms."
 hlz.17.a:0 "Herr Stelzner has the correct plan."
 hlz.17.b:0 "We should benefit from the experiences of the Rthaur and follow Frau Isthyne's policies."
 hlz.17.c:0 "Frau Katzmann's approach is the best."
 hlz.18.t:0 "Fate of the Aristocracy"
 hlz.18.d:0 "The Republic has been firmly established in Holzbrenn, and Republican ideals are being disseminated among the populace. As our new system of governance demands equality of all, we clearly must do away with the feudal ruling class of the aristocracy. How should we deal with them?"
 hlz.18.a:0 "We can grant them titular titles to placate the Union."
 hlz.18.b:0 "They shall be introduced into Republican society as normal citizens."
 hlz.18.c:0 "Send them to their relatives in other Freiprinztümer, there is no place for them here!"
 hlz.19.t:0 "Holzbrenn Abolishes Aristocracy!"
 hlz.19.d:0 "Word has reached us that, following a Republican revolt that ousted Freiprinz Rosenblut, the people of Holzbrenn have done away with noble titles and instated Republican governance! The court is up in arms, but our advisors urge caution."
 hlz.19.a:0 "As long as they send a representative to the Princely Diet, it is of no concern."
 hlz.19.b:0 "Demand they re-instate the natural order of things!"
 hlz.20.t:0 "Holzbrenn Exiles Nobility!"
 hlz.20.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the people of Holzbrenn have ousted all of their noble families following a Republican revolution! The rest of the Freiprinzen are livid at this, and demand an immediate re-instatement of nobility in Holzbrenn."
 hlz.20.a:0 "We have bigger concerns to deal with."
 hlz.20.b:0 "Demand the return of the nobility to Holzbrenn at once!"
 hlz.21.t:0 "The Hochprinzessin's Demand"
 hlz.21.d:0 "Word has reached us from the court of the Hochprinztum today - Adalina demands an immediate reinstatement of noble titles and privileges. She has made it very clear that if we do not comply, she will be very tempted to back Pressler's claim on the Freithron of Holzbrenn."
 hlz.21.a:0 "We cannot stand against the Hochprinztum."
 hlz.21.b:0 "Never!"
 hlz.22.t:0 "The Hochprinzessin's Demand"
 hlz.22.d:0 "Word has reached us from the court of the Hochprinztum today - Adalina demands an immediate reinstatement of noble titles and privileges. She has made it very clear that if we do not comply, she will be very tempted to back Pressler's claim on the Freithron of Holzbrenn."
 hlz.22.a:0 "We cannot stand against the Hochprinztum."
 hlz.22.b:0 "Never!"
 hlz.23.t:0 "Holzbrenn Defiant"
 hlz.23.d:0 "It seems the people of Holzbrenn stubbornly have refused a direct order from the Hochprinzessin herself, refusing to reinstate noble privileges. We have readied a letter of support for Pressler, as well as a contigent of troops and funds for his counter-revolution, all we need is Adalina's consent."
 hlz.23.a:0 "Pride cometh before the fall. Send the troops to Pressler!"
 hlz.23.b:0 "We cannot foster open conflict at such a fragile time, back down."
 hlz.24.t:0 "Deciding our Electoral System"
 hlz.24.d:0 "Our government has up until now been formed by hastily-elected officials, with the electorate at the time being limited to whoever happened to be out on the streets when the revolutionaries seized control. This is clearly not the basis for a legitimate system of governance, so we must now decide how to hold elections in the future."
 hlz.24.a:0 "One citizen, one vote!"
 hlz.24.b:0 "We must elect our representatives from electoral districts!"
 hlz.24.c:0 "We must decentralize power as much as possible!"
 hlz.25.t:0 "Pressler Takes Over!"
 hlz.25.d:0 "We have been too lax in dealing with Pressler, and he and his men have marched on Holzbrenn, seizing power and placing the current government under house arrest!"
 hlz.25.a:0 "We have failed our people."
 hlz.26.t:0 "Pressler Captured!"
 hlz.26.d:0 "Good tidings - Pressler has been bought to us in chains! He has become so universally reviled that he has been extradited to us to stand trial for his consipracy against the Freiprinztum."
 hlz.26.a:0 "He shall face justice!"
 hlz.27.t:0 "Pressler Slain!"
 hlz.27.d:0 "Excellent news! Our agressive measures have accomplished what we wanted them to - Pressler has been slain by a daring band of adventurers! They have bought his head to the government as proof, and all have been rewarded handsomely."
 hlz.27.a:0 "He shall be judged in the afterlife."
 hlz.28.t:0 "Our Place in the Union"
 hlz.28.d:0 "Though we formally are loyal to Adalina, her grasp on the Freithron is quite weak. Freiprinz Schwarzenbach of Stahlhof, in the meanwhile, has contacted us in secret and requested that we back his bid to become Hochprinz in a coup. What should we do?"
 hlz.28.a:0 "Stahlhof is too weak, we back Adalina."
 hlz.28.b:0 "It is in our national interest to support Stahlhof."
 hlz.28.c:0 "We shall stake our own claim on the Freithron!"

 prk.11.b:0 "What was good enough for our ancestors is good enough for us!"
 prk.12.t:0 "The Perkav Census Completed!"
 prk.12.d:0 "Over the past months, officials from the Union have been meticiously recording how many people live in our lands, as well as how many heads of cattle and acres of land they posess. They claim that this knowledge is fundamental towards building a modern state, particularly when it comes to taxation and recruitment. More importantly, they have created a writing system for the Perkav language and taught most Chieftains, including Krell, as well as some administrators to read and write, so we can actually keep track of this data."
 prk.12.a:0 "Let us make use of this knowledge!"
 prk.13.t:0 "The University of Perkavland"
 prk.13.d:0 "The Union has sent over many scholars in the past week, as well as architects and construction workers to build our very first university - as well as the first multi-level stone building in all of Perkavland. These scholars have begun to teach the best and brightest of Perkavland, and they have given brief but intensive courses on basic literacy and science to many of our town elders, who have gone back to their community to teach there. Our society is slowly becoming literate!"
 prk.13.a:0 "I can't wait for someone to write my saga down in an epic poem!"
 prk.14.t:0 "Introduction of Writing"
 prk.14.d:0 "Ungerdaler scholars have, after learning our language, created an alphabet and system of writing for us, based on their own. This will allow us to record our stories instead of relying on storytellers - and, more importantly, track precisely who owes us taxes, and how much."
 prk.14.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 prk.15.t:0 "Allow Septist Preachers?"
 prk.15.d:0 "A group of Northerners have arrived in Krell's Hall today, requesting permission to preach among our people. What should we do?"
 prk.15.a:0 "Seven Gods? Not just one? How intruiging..."
 prk.15.b:0 "Thank you, but our ancestors' faith is good enough for us."
 prk.16.t:0 "A Septist Country"
 prk.16.d:0 "The priests of the Northern lands have returned to Krell's hall with pride, reporting that they had managed to convert most of the major cities to their faith. Apparently, the centre of the country proved more resistant to conversion than the coasts, with Rlavya even refusing them access, but most of the people have now abandoned our old God in favour of the Septist religion. It is time for Krell to officially declare a national conversion."
 prk.16.a:0 "Praise the Seven!"
 prk.17.t:0 "Reactionary Civil War!"
 prk.17.d:0 "It seems that the many changes in our society have not pleased anyone. Chieftains displeased with their loss of autonomy, priests concerned about the influence of the Northern faith and those that believe we are becoming a puppet of the Northerners have taken up in arms in order to depose Krell and roll back all the reforms we have made!"
 prk.17.a:0 "We must put down these anachronistic rabble-rousers!"
 prk.17.b:0 "We must stand up for the old ways against the Northerners and their lackey, Krell!"
 prk.18.t:0 "Krell Deposed"
 prk.18.d:0 "The true sons and daughters of Perkavland have risen up and cast off the corrupting influence of the Northerners, and Krell and his cronies have fled to their lands. Clearly, his Hall should no longer bear its name."
 prk.18.a:0 "Long live King Zlatko!"
 prk.18.b:0 "Wait, HOW big is his ale stockpile? I think I might move here..."
 prk.19.t:0 "Administrative Reforms"
 prk.19.d:0 "The Union's clerks and bureaucrats have, after reviewing the data collected by the Census and extensive deliberation with Krell, proposed several reforms intended to centralize power and lay the foundations for a modern Perkav government. Though we still have much to do, several of these reforms are already paying off."
 prk.19.a:0 "This is excellent news!"
 prk.20.t:0 "The Coronation of King Wendelin"
 prk.20.d:0 "After all the reforms, both politically and administratively, we have finally arrived at a point where power is centralized and formalized enough to officially declare Wendelin the King of Perkavland! Some of the Chieftains, now Dukes, are murmuring discontent, but most have applauded this institutionalization of feudal relations as a means of cementing their power."
 prk.20.a:0 "Hail to the King!"
 prk.21.t:0 "The Union Offers Vassalage"
 prk.21.d:0 "Adalina's representatives have met with Krell today, offering him a Freithron. They claim that the Union will interfere little with our day-to-day governance, and the benefits to our economy and defense would be enormous. Critics, however, fear that we may be dragged into pointless wars."
 prk.21.a:0 "It is in our interests, and theirs."
 prk.21.b:0 "They will have to be content with mutual guarantees."
 prk.22.t:0 "Goods Plundered!"
 prk.22.d:0 "Our raiders have returned to port, bringing with them many clothes, foodstuffs and other useful tools. Excellent work."
 prk.22.a:0 "Praise Krostov!"
 prk.23.t:0 "Weapons Plundered!"
 prk.23.d:0 "Our raiders have returned to port, bringing with them swords, axes, and suits of armour. Our warriors can put these to good use."
 prk.23.a:0 "Praise Krostov!"
 prk.24.t:0 "Knowledge Plundered!"
 prk.24.d:0 "Our raiders have returned to port, bringing with them scrolls of knowledge, which our wise men are already deciphering. Excellent work."
 prk.24.a:0 "Praise Krostov!"
 prk.25.t:0 "Artifact Plundered!"
 prk.25.d:0 "Our raiders have returned to port, bringing with them a priceless artifact!"
 prk.25.a:0 "This item is worthy of [Root.GetLeader]!"
 prk.25.b:0 "Grant it to one of our commanders!"
 prk.26.t:0 "Raiders Clamour to Set Out!"
 prk.26.d:0 "It has been a long time since our last raid. Our brave adventurers are calling for another raiding fleet to leave port."
 prk.26.a:0 "Hoist up the... thing.. flag.. it's been a long time!"
 prk.27.t:0 "Adventurers Fought Off!"
 prk.27.d:0 "Our brave warriors set off to plunder the ships of the Northerners, but sadly, it seems that they were beaten off. Many have been left in a watery grave as our ships limp back to port."
 prk.27.a:0 "It happens to the best of us."
 prk.28.t:0 "Union-Bergialer Joint Patrols!"
 prk.28.d:0 "In response to our bands of adventurers roaming the seas, the Men of the Union and the Bergialer Dwarves have instituted joint naval patrols in the waters their merchants frequent. It seems acquiring spoils will become more difficult now."
 prk.28.a:0 "Good. I like a proper fight."

 perkav_schneefilder_sack.1.d:0 "We have pulled off the most daring raid in Perkav history and plundered the mighty city of Schneefilde itself! Its untold riches have been laden on cart after cart, and some particularly creative warlords have put wheels on their boats to be able to bring more treasure and slaves back. The Sack of Schneefilde shall go down in history!"
 perkav_schneefilder_sack.1.a:0 "All hail Warlord Krell!"
 perkav_schneefilder_sack.2.t:0 "Defeat at Schneefilde"
 perkav_schneefilder_sack.2.d:0 "It seems even the mightiest Perkav army to ever march Northwards was not enough to secure victory. The Schneefilder forces, although initially caught on the back foot and hard-pressed by our fearsome warriors, managed to regroup and drive us back. Our last-ditch charge at the walls of the city was repelled by the citizenry of Schneefilde, and we have been forced to retreat."
 perkav_schneefilder_sack.2.a:0 "This is a bitter humiliation."
 perkav_schneefilder_sack.3.t:0 "Stalemate at Schneefilde"
 perkav_schneefilder_sack.3.d:0 "While our armies saw initial success, breaking down the gate of Schneefilde, they have unfortunately been pushed back by a co-ordinated effort. While we did not suffer a total defeat, it is clear that we did not achieve our objectives either."

 schneefilde_schneefilder_sack.2.d:0 "The marauding hordes of Perkavland have stormed through our lands in a violent orgy of destruction, leaving death and destruction in their wake. This has culminated in the plundering and razing of our capital! The city of Schneefilde lies in ashes, a large part of its population dead, fled or homeless. This is a dark day for Schneefilde."

 schneefilde_schneefilder_sack.3.t:0 "The Raid on Schneefilde"
 schneefilde_schneefilder_sack.3.d:0 "The hordes from Perkavland came to plunder our lands, and though they nearly succeeded, the brave citizen's militia of Schneefilde, led by a blonde-haired humand and a strange-looking one-eyed Dwarf with a giant battle axe, have managed to repel the Perkav raiders just as they broke through their gate. Though our countryside is still in ruins and it will take time to rebuild, it could have been worse."
