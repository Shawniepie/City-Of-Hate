 random.1.t:0 "An Artifact in the Mountains?"
 random.1.d:0 "Rumours of a powerful magical item in the Weltsäule Mountains have reached court today. The reports conflict as to the exact nature of this object, but all agree it is a powerful boon to whoever wields it."
 random.1.a:0 "Organize an expedition at once!"
 random.1.b:0 "We have better things to do than hunt after rumours."
 random.2.t:0 "Expedition Reaches the Mountains"
 random.2.d:0 "Today, just before sunset, the expedition arrived at the edge of the Weltsäule. They are restocking in a small town in the shadow of the nearest peaks and are preparing to set out at first light tomorrow."
 random.2.a:0 "We draw close to our goal."
 random.2.b:0 "Turn back, it's too dangerous."
 random.3.t:0 "A Guiding Light?"
 random.3.d:0 "An old man who claims to know the path to our destination has offered his services as a guide. Though some of our men regard him as somewhat shifty, he might significantly increase our chances of success."
 random.3.a:0 "Hire him, a guide could be useful."
 random.3.b:0 "This man is clearly a thief."
 random.4.t:0 "A Magical Ring!"
 random.4.d:0 "After delving through ancient ruins, avoiding many deadly traps and boisterous monsters, our expedition has uncovered a golden ring set with a single sapphire. The legends written on the wall it was found in, in Dwarvish, turned out to be the story of an ancient Dwarven Emperor who wore the ring and was bestowed with untold riches."
 random.4.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 random.5.t:0 "A Magical Sword!"
 random.5.d:0 "After delving through ancient ruins, avoiding many deadly traps and boisterous monsters, our expedition has uncovered a magical sword, sharp despite its age. The legends written on the wall it was found in, in Dwarvish, turned out to be the story of an ancient barbarian warlord who wielded this blade. None could stand before him."
 random.5.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 random.6.t:0 "A Thief Among Us!"
 random.6.d:0 "It turns out we should not have hired the guide after all. This morning, the expedition woke up to find both the old man and the artifact gone."
 random.6.a:0 "Curses!"
 random.7.t:0 "The Expedition Returns"
 random.7.d:0 "Today, the expedition has returned to the capital, proudly displaying the artifact they recovered before handing it over to our ruler. Even if it is not magical, this show of power and prestige has greatly impressed the masses."
 random.7.a:0 "A glorious day!"
 random.8.t:0 "Naught but Dust and Stones"
 random.8.d:0 "Alas, it seems that our expedition has been unsuccesful. Our men spent a week searching the area where the tomb with the artifact should be, but all they found were rocks and insects. They have returned empty-handed."
 random.8.a:0 "A shame."
 generic.1.t:0 "Governmental Crisis!"
 generic.1.d:0 "Our country is in uproar against the current government, with citizen militias of various convictions erecting makeshift barricades and clashing with the town watch! There have even been reports of army defections to the rebels, and the situation is spiralling out of control - what should we do?"
 generic.1.a:0 "This is clearly the work of seditious foreigners!"
 generic.1.b:0 "The old ways are tried and true, we must cling to the nobility!"
 generic.1.c:0 "We've had enough of your corrupt aristocracy - let the people be heard!"
 generic.1.e:0 "Piety and prayer are the only answers to these dire times!"
 generic.2.t:0 "Puritan Coup!"
 generic.2.d:0 "Having made gains in all strata of societies lately (except, obviously, the racial minorities), the Puritans have increased in power and influence to the point where they have successfully staged a coup! Our government officials have been swiftly arrested by Puritan army elements, and those that have professed a pro-xenos bent have been dealt with. It seems that the new regime has secured their power base quickly - so quickly, in fact, that this must have been a very well-planned coup."
 generic.2.a:0 "At long last, we can purge the xenos from our lands!"
 generic.3.t:0 "Order Maintained"
 generic.3.d:0 "The nobility has acted quickly, with the monarch and the aristocrats setting aside their differences to unite against those that would threaten the stability of the nation. The unrest in the streets has died down, and the nobility is already back to its old infighting..."
 generic.3.a:0 "The monarch cleverly check-mates the aristocracy and seizes unrestrained power!"
 generic.3.b:0 "The monarch and the aristocrats negotiate a compromise!"
 generic.3.c:0 "The aristocracy pressures the monarch into handing over his powers to the aristocracy!"
 generic.4.t:0 "Call for Elections!"
 generic.4.d:0 "Tensions in the country have reached a breaking point, and the various disorganized riots have transformed into an organized revolution! Although a civil war seemed imminent, this was prevented by the defection of the Royal Guard, who have placed the monarch and most powerful nobles under arrest! Emergency elections have been scheduled - who shall lead our newly-forged Republic?"
 generic.4.a:0 "The Guildists emerge victorious - liberty for all!"
 generic.4.b:0 "The Rosites carry the day - justice for all!"
 generic.5.t:0 "Religious Coup!"
 generic.5.d:0 "The increased piety in our country as a whole and our government in particular has led to a massive growth in the power of the Church, and they have finally acted - the priests have declared themselves the new government, denouncing the old regime as sinful and heretical, and the majority of the population seems to accept this decree for now. The old rulers have been apprehended by zealous elements of the army and are now awaiting divine judgement."
 generic.5.a:0 "Praise be!"
 generic.6.t:0 "The Royal Front"
 generic.6.d:0 "The situation is dire - dire enough to force even the aristocrats to stop their factionalism and infighting for the moment, and present an united front against the threat of mob rule. The various nobles of our nation have raised their banners alongside those of our monarch, and the army is being sent out across the country to put down the uprisings that plague our nation."
 generic.6.a:0 "Everything must be done to keep the commoners in their place."
 generic.7.t:0 "The Republican Front"
 generic.7.d:0 "There appears to have been contact between the various rebel groups that have consolidated out of the protest mobs, and it appears this is bad news - they have put aside their differences for now and stand united against our regime!"
 generic.7.a:0 "Spare us from this mob rule!"
 generic.8.t:0 "A Shameful Display"
 generic.8.d:0 "A scandal has rocked the halls of power today as the two top advisors on economic matters have physically assaulted one another in the middle of a debate! One advisor, the representative of the merchant class, insists on giving the Guilds a free hand in economical matters, while our Minister of Economics claims we should do away with the Guilds! It is clear we cannot keep both at court - whose advice should we heed?"
 generic.8.a:0 "The Guilds are the hearts and soul of our prosperity!"
 generic.8.b:0 "The Guilds are an outdated institution with no place in a modern society!"
 generic.9.t:0 "Officers Brawl!"
 generic.9.d:0 "Embarrassing news form a rather agitated innkeeper today - apparently, a general and an admiral were having a drink in her tavern today, discussing the merits of the army versus the navy. Polite disagreement rapidly heated up into a fist-fight, which sparked a tavern brawl that attracted further soldiers and sailors to fight for their respective officers! We have already paid damages to the innkeep, but we must resolve the army-navy dispute before such a thing happens again."
 generic.9.a:0 "The army must always come first!"
 generic.9.b:0 "The navy is vital to our continued prosperity and must be prioritized!"
 generic.10.t:0 "The Best Laid Plans..."
 generic.10.d:0 "An incident has been bought to our attention today - in an otherwise irrelevant border skirmish with one of our neighbours, one of our generals apparently led his men to charge our own troops, seemingly in the belief that he had 'outmaneuvered a hostile force' and was 'saving the day with a glorious charge'. It is clear our current military staff is not up to standards, and those few competent generals we have are all squabbling over whose doctrine we should adopt."
 generic.10.a:0 "If they'd been cavalry, they would've been able to actually flank!"
 generic.10.b:0 "This would have never happened with a professional army!"
 generic.10.c:0 "Who cares? We have plenty of peasants."
 generic.10.e:0 "Better organization and discipline will prevent future incidents."
 merc.1.t:0 "Perkav Mercenary Contraxt Expires"
 merc.1.d:0 "The mercenary warriors of Perkavland have served our armies for the six months their contract stipulated, and we now have to decide if we wish to extend it."
 merc.1.a:0 "Their ferocity shall be missed, but their odour shan't."
 merc.1.b:0 "We still have need of them - extend their contract!"
 alliance.1.t:0 "The Ungerdaler United Front"
 alliance.1.d:0 "With the fall of the Hochprinztum, the Freiprinzen have become disunited. One of the Freiprinztümer has now stepped in to suggest an alliance of Freiprinzen against outside threats, and we have been invited to join."
 alliance.1.a:0 "The Freiprinzen must stay united!"
 alliance.1.b:0 "No, the Union is dead!"
 ord.1.t:0 "The Autumn Debate Commences"
 ord.1.d:0 "It has taken a long time to organise the summit and send out the invitations, but at long last all important nobles, priests and other prominent figures of Ordoria have been assembled in Varinthia. From the start it is clear that three rough factions have formed: the Moderates, under the leadership of King Galerin Valinthir, the Traditionalists, led by the King's Steward, Isvenith Lothinnys, and the Faithful, the religious faction commanded by the High Priest, Histarine Vernythe. These three factions will now struggle with each other over the future of Ordoria."
 ord.1.a:0 "Let us hope for a swift and fruitful debate."
 ord.2.t:0 "Domestic-Economic Policy"
 ord.2.d:0 "The first point of debate is the treatment of the other races in our country, as well as our economic plans. The Traditionalists argue for the immediate enslavement of all 'sub-Elven vermin' and putting them to work in labour camps for their heavy industrialization programs, while the Faithful propose witch hunts and religious courts to deal with the vermin, relying on Ordorian labour alone to build a war economy and relying on a swift reconquest of our Eastern lands to salvage our civilian economic situation. The speaker for the Moderates on this matter, where the faction is a definite minority, was almost booed off the speaker's platform when she suggested allowing the most skilled 'demi-Elves' to stay and work."
 ord.2.a:0 "The Moderates' economic arguments sway the powerful with promises of wealth!"
 ord.2.b:0 "The Traditionalists sweep the debate easily."
 ord.2.c:0 "The fiery rhetoric of Vernythe carries the day for the Faithful!"
 ord.3.t:0 "Foreign Policy"
 ord.3.d:0 "With the matter of the treatment of the other races settled, the topic of foreign policy has come up. Perhaps surprisingly, the seemingly most popular plan is the Moderates' proposal for a temporary alliance with the Realm and the Union, so we can focus on dealing with the rebels, who they consider the 'real' enemy. Meanwhile, both the Traditionalists and the Faithful argue for agressive expansionism, though the Faithful insist on a more spiritual bent to our endeavours than the Traditionalists."
 ord.3.a:0 "The Moderates' plan for Rthaur containment wins over the nobles!"
 ord.3.b:0 "Lothinnys' doctrine of Ordorian hegemony sways the warmongers!"
 ord.3.c:0 "The Faithful proposal for an Extermination Crusade resonates with the zealous!"
 ord.4.t:0 "Military Policy"
 ord.4.d:0 "As debate around foreign policy dies down, the army's current state is called into question. It is clear that some reforms are needed, but what direction should we go in?"
 ord.4.a:0 "Rapid raiding parties can strike terror in the hearts of our enemies - the Moderates!"
 ord.4.b:0 "We must stop losing ground before thinking of conquests - the Traditionalists!"
 ord.4.c:0 "We've been on the back foot for long enough - the Faithful army of aggression!"
 ord.5.t:0 "Moderate Victory!"
 ord.5.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Moderates have come out on top! Many of our more conservative assembly members have loudly protested this, but it seems that, for now at least, our policy of Elven supremacy will be abandoned in favour of realpolitik and a more overt anti-Radicalism."
 ord.5.a:0 "For too long have we made enemies. It's time to look for some friends, instead."
 ord.6.t:0 "Traditionalist Victory!"
 ord.6.d:0 "It appears that the Traditionalist faction has emerged victorious from the summit. We will have to alter some parts of our government, of course, as compromises had to be made, but by and large we shall carry on as before."
 ord.6.a:0 "Domestic stability has been secured. Next stop: Quellion!"
 ord.7.t:0 "Faithful Victory!"
 ord.7.d:0 "The religious convictions and fierce oratory of the Faithful has seen them convince the summit of their Crusade plans. Already orders have been sent to weaponsmiths across the nation to ramp up their production - the holy cleansing of the continent shall no doubt begin soon."
 ord.7.a:0 "Praise the Seven!"
 ord.8.t:0 "Deadlock: Traditionalist-Faithful Coalition"
 ord.8.d:0 "The assembly seems very divided, and no faction has managed to gain the upper hand. To allow for any governance at all, and more importantly to stop the Moderates from gaining traction, the Traditionalists and the Faithful have hashed out a compromise both can tolerate. Neither side is happy with the agreement, but they agree it's better than letting the Moderates have their say."
 ord.8.a:0 "Anything to keep the Moderates out!"
 ord.9.t:0 "The Union Listens"
 ord.9.d:0 "To the surprise of some of our diplomats, High Princess Adelina has decided to hear us out! We have offered her a pact of non-aggression, to grow into an alliance once Arthenon responds, in exchange for the return of certain territories lost to the enroaching Stahlhoffers. However, our advisors are divided on how much we should ask for - if we demand too much, we risk angering the High Princess, or the Prince of Stalhof..."
 ord.9.a:0 "Stahlhof is to return all unjustly seized land!"
 ord.9.b:0 "We will be happy with the return of our most important provinces - for now."
 ord.9.c:0 "We'll cut them a deal - Ghithys and Ancyte for the return of Utrocyle and Ythlycthis"
 ord.10.t:0 "The Union Rejects Our Overtures"
 ord.10.d:0 "Our ambassadors to the Union have returned without success. Apparently, Adelina's court treated them with scorn - one general even spat in the face of our most respected envoy! This has reflected extremely poorly on the Moderates - there's rumours of seditions. One more blunder like this and our enemies might attempt a coup!"
 ord.10.a:0 "Damn them!"
 ord.11.t:0 "The Union Agrees!"
 ord.11.d:0 "High Princess Adelina has decided to support our demands! An order has been sent to the Freeprincedom to immediately vacate all of our lands, and our army stands ready to reoccupy the provinces - whether Stahlhof allows us to or not."
 ord.11.a:0 "Let's hope Stahlhof complies..."
 ord.12.t:0 "The Union Declines!"
 ord.12.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems we asked too much of the Ungerdaler Union - our diplomats have returned with empty hands. Our enemies at court are laughing behind our backs - we'd better score a victory soon, or they might make a move..."
 ord.12.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.13.t:0 "The Union Agrees!"
 ord.13.d:0 "It was a wise move to make modest demands - High Princess Adelina has backed our demands! Stahlhof is now facing pressure from both us and their overlord to return Utrocyle and Ythlycthis."
 ord.13.a:0 "Let's hope Stahlhof complies..."
 ord.14.t:0 "The Union Declines!"
 ord.14.d:0 "Unfortunately, it seems even our limited demands were too much for the Ungerdaler Union - our diplomats have returned with empty hands. Our enemies at court are laughing behind our backs - we'd better score a victory soon, or they might make a move..."
 ord.14.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.15.t:0 "The Union Agrees!"
 ord.15.d:0 "Good news - High Princess Adelina has agreed to our suggested exchange of territories! Our troops are vacating Ghithys and Ancyte, along with some Traditionalists and Faithful who do not want to live under Human rule, and now stand ready to reclaim Utrocyle and Ythlycthis."
 ord.15.a:0 "Let's hope Stahlhof complies..."
 ord.16.t:0 "Arthenon Agrees"
 ord.16.d:0 "Excellent news from the North - the Grand Master has agreed to our suggestion of a non-aggression pact, to be formalized into an alliance at the earliest possible opportunity! This has greatly enhanced the prestige of the Moderates."
 ord.16.a:0 "Just as planned!"
 ord.17.t:0 "The Realm Rejects our Proposal"
 ord.17.d:0 "Bad news from the north - Arthenon has decided to not sign our pact. This is a problem for the Moderate faction, whose competence is called into question."
 ord.17.a:0 "Damn him!"
 ord.18.t:0 "Stahlhof Submits!"
 ord.18.d:0 "Word has reached us that the Freeprincedom of Stahlhof has seen reason and agreed to return our lands to us. This has greatly enhanced the legitimacy of the Moderate government."
 ord.18.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ord.19.t:0 "Stahlhof Refuses!"
 ord.19.d:0 "Despite direct orders from the High Princess, the Prince of Stahlhof refuses to return our lands! On the upside, the Ungerdaler diplomats at our court have subtly let us know that the Union would not intervene if we were to take what is ours by force..."
 ord.19.a:0 "Teach them a lesson!"
 ord.19.b:0 "Back down for now."
 ord.20.t:0 "Stahlhof Submits!"
 ord.20.d:0 "Word has reached us that the Freeprincedom of Stahlhof has seen reason and agreed to return our lands to us. This has greatly enhanced the legitimacy of the Moderate government."
 ord.20.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ord.21.t:0 "Stahlhof Refuses!"
 ord.21.d:0 "Despite direct orders from the High Princess, the Prince of Stahlhof refuses to return our lands! On the upside, the Ungerdaler diplomats at our court have subtly let us know that the Union would not intervene if we were to take what is ours by force..."
 ord.21.a:0 "Teach them a lesson!"
 ord.21.b:0 "Back down for now."
 ord.22.t:0 "Stahlhof Submits!"
 ord.22.d:0 "Word has reached us that the Freeprincedom of Stahlhof has seen reason and agreed to our proposed exchange. This has greatly enhanced the legitimacy of the Moderate government."
 ord.22.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ord.23.t:0 "Stahlhof Refuses!"
 ord.23.d:0 "Despite direct orders from the High Princess, the Prince of Stahlhof refuses our suggestion of exchange! On the upside, the Ungerdaler diplomats at our court have subtly let us know that the Union would not intervene if we were to take what is ours by force..."
 ord.23.a:0 "Teach them a lesson!"
 ord.23.b:0 "Back down for now."
 ord.24.t:0 "Southern Lands Reclaimed"
 ord.24.d:0 "People across our proud nation are celebrating as word has reached us that we have fully reclaimed our lands to the South! The Stahlhoffers have been expelled, and those displaced by the enroaching Humans are slowly returning to their homes. This is a great day for Ordoria!"
 ord.24.a:0 "A testament to Elven might!"
 ord.25.t:0 "The Union Declines!"
 ord.25.d:0 "Despite our extremely generous offer, the Ungerdaler Union has seen fit to reject our proposal - there is an outcry, and even some of our Moderate councillors are beginning to doubt our government's current course..."
 ord.25.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.26.t:0 "Traditionalist Coup Fails!"
 ord.26.d:0 "Our country was in shock today as word spread of an attempted Traditionalist coup! It seems several disgruntled generals and nobles, with the backing of several prominent clergymen, attempted to seize Istaroth and proclaim the reinstatement of the old government. Fortunately, our people's faith in the Moderate government has greatly grown following our successes, and the Traditionalist's call to arms was barely heeded. Those involved in the attempted coup have swiftly been arrested and are now facing judgement."
 ord.26.a:0 "We shall not go back to the genocidal insanity of the past!"
 ord.27.t:0 "Traditionalist Coup Succeeds!"
 ord.27.d:0 "People across the country rejoice as several righteous generals and nobles, with the backing of the holy Church, have successfully arrested the Moderate government and reinstated Traditionalist rule today. The blundering of the Moderates has caused great discontent amongst the populace, and they are happy to see a competent government restored. A great day for Ordoria!"
 ord.27.a:0 "An end to this appeasement of vermin!"
 ord.28.t:0 "Traditionalist Civil War!"
 ord.28.d:0 "Our nation is reeling from an attempted Traditionalist coup! This morning, an army of disgruntled soldiers and nobles, backed by a good portion of the Church, marched on Istaroth, seizing the capital and proclaiming the reinstatement of the old government! However, a good portion of the land, including the city of Varinthia, has openly condemned this coup and is rallying to drive the Traditionalists out. It seems a civil war is unavoidable!"
 ord.28.a:0 "A fine excuse to rid ourselves of the Traditionalist scum!"
 ord.28.b:0 "Rid our people of this Moderate insanity!"
 ord.29.t:0 "Eastern Ordoria Reclaimed!"
 ord.29.d:0 "After a gruelling campaign through the jungles of the East, we have finally brought the rebels to their knees! Quellion is ours, and the rebels' leaders are being rounded up and executed wherever we can find them. We must now decide what to do with our lands."
 ord.29.a:0 "We cannot allow them even a sliver of autonomy - integrate them!"
 ord.29.b:0 "If we give them a taste of freedom, it will keep them complacent - set up a vassal state!"
 ord.30.t:0 "Skaelinger Offers Peace"
 ord.30.d:0 "It seems the direness of their position has finally seeped through the thick skulls of the Dwarves - their diplomats formally offered peace today. What should our response be?"
 ord.30.a:0 "We've taught them their lesson - we have bigger fish to fry."
 ord.30.b:0 "Peace suits us, but they must accept some border adjustments."
 ord.30.c:0 "Peace?! We shall give them the peace of the grave!"
 ord.30.e:0 "If they swear fealty to the Ordorian Crown, they shall have their peace."
 ord.31.t:0 "Concessions - Skaelinger Accepts"
 ord.31.d:0 "Good news! Skaelinger accepts our proposed border changes - they have vacated the designated mountain ranges and passes, and our engineers are already en route to fortify these crucial strategic positions - our Eastern flank shall evermore be secure!"
 ord.31.a:0 "Excellent!"
 ord.32.t:0 "Concessions - Skaelinger Declines!"
 ord.32.d:0 "Despite their desperate situation, it seems the Dwarves are as stubborn as ever - they have refused our demands!"
 ord.32.a:0 "Their mistake."
 ord.33.t:0 "Vassalage - Skaelinger Accepts"
 ord.33.d:0 "It seems enough brute force can break even a Dwarf's will - the High King of Skaelinger has agreed to bend the knee as our vassal!"
 ord.33.a:0 "They have seen reason."
 ord.34.t:0 "Vassalage - Skaelinger Refuses"
 ord.34.d:0 "Dwarven stupidity knows no bounds - despite their impossible situation, Skaelinger refuses to swear fealty to us!"
 ord.34.a:0 "Their mistake."
 ord.35.t:0 "Punish Stahlhof"
 ord.35.d:0 "The arrogance of Stahlhof knows no bounds, and they have been as brash as laying their filthy hands on our lands! This ends now - we are going to march in and retake what is ours!"
 ord.35.a:0 "Forward!"
 ord.36.t:0 "Stahlhof Accepts!"
 ord.36.d:0 "Great news! Stahlhof has accepted our proposal, and though they will maintain a masquerade of loyalty for now, they will join us when the time is right."
 ord.36.a:0 "Our plans advance..."
 ord.37.t:0 "Stahlhof Rejects!"
 ord.37.d:0 "Those damned Stahlhoffers have the guts to reject our generous offer! We will have to proceed without their support."
 ord.37.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.38.t:0 "The Stahlhof Gambit"
 ord.38.d:0 "While the men of Stahlhof have been enroaching on our territory for decades and the ambition of their Freiprinz knows no bounds, perhaps this ambition can be turned to our cause. Rumor has it that Schwarzenbach's attacks on our lands are a mere ruse, allowing him to build up an army under the pretense of fighting us while in reality planning to seize the Freithron. Several of our advisors have now proposed a deal: Stahlhof returns our lands, and they get to rule the Union - under our benevolent guidance, of course."
 ord.38.a:0 "I do love an ironic plot twist..."
 ord.38.b:0 "Working with Stahlhof? Never!"
 ord.39.t:0 "Rthaur Resistance!"
 ord.39.d:0 "Though we have conquered the lands of the Rthaur rebels, they have not been cured of their foolish ideas. Apparently, they are building an underground network in our country, seeking to launch our nation into another civil war! If we do not integrate the rebel's lands quickly, we may yet lose all that we have gained!"
 ord.39.a:0 "Damnation!"
 ord.40.t:0 "Second Rthaur Revolution!"
 ord.40.d:0 "Though the wise among our advisors warned us of the dangers of the rebels' resistance, we did not heed their advice in time. The rebel's ideology has spread through our nation like a cancer, and they have risen up in open revolt, even stronger than the last time!"
 ord.40.a:0 "We've beaten them before, we'll beat them again!"
 ord.40.b:0 "We shall break the chains one final time!"
 ord.41.t:0 "Slave Revolt in Wethaur!"
 ord.41.d:0 "The vermin in one of our logging operations in Wethaur have revolted! Though their rebellion is disorganized, it has the potential to spread like wildfire if we don't act decisively!"
 ord.41.a:0 "Give them two meals a day instead of one, that should pacify their stupid little minds."
 ord.41.b:0 "The local Grove Guards will handle it."
 ord.42.t:0 "Slave Leader Emerges"
 ord.42.d:0 "It appears that local law enforcement has been unable to shatter the rebellious vermin quickly enough. A leader has emerged from amongst them, and the unorganised mass of vermin has turned into a guerillia army inside our own borders."
 ord.42.a:0 "Local law enforcement will have to try harder."
 ord.42.b:0 "Send in the army!"
 ord.43.t:0 "Revolt Crushed"
 ord.43.d:0 "The slave revolt is crushed! The heads of the ringleaders now stand on spikes in front of the slave's encampment, serving as a reminder to the vermin to know their place. Their spirit seems to have been broken."
 ord.43.a:0 "Back to business as usual."
 ord.44.t:0 "Traditionalist Riot!"
 ord.44.d:0 "It seems our tolerance of the demi-Elves in our country has angered the sympathisers of the Traditionalist factio, who are now rioting in the streets, attacking demi-Elven passersby and vandalizing propert!"
 ord.44.a:0 "I'm sure those demi-Elves started it!"
 ord.44.b:0 "Unacceptable - send in law enforcement!"
 ord.45.t:0 "Law Enforcement Joins Rioters!"
 ord.45.d:0 "It seems our guards are not exempt from racial prejudices - instead of stopping the riots, they are joining them! Demi-Elven businesses are being robbed and set on fire, and those demi-Elves that resist are beaten and jailed."
 ord.45.a:0 "Pull in law enforcement from other cities!"
 ord.45.b:0 "That's it - send in the troops!"
 ord.46.t:0 "Traditionalists Subdued!"
 ord.46.d:0 "Our actions have had their desired effects - the Traditionalist rioters have been subdued, and the day-to-day order of business has been restored!"
 ord.46.a:0 "Let's hope the economic damage was limited."
 ord.47.t:0 "Nobles Protest Austerity"
 ord.47.d:0 "A delegation of nobles has petitioned the government today, complaining about the austerity measures we have passed. They claim that it is their right to enjoy themselves as they see fit - how should we respond?"
 ord.47.a:0 "If they insist... let them eat cake!"
 ord.47.b:0 "They will change their tune once the Inquisition pays a visit to their homes."
 ord.48.t:0 "Nobles Attempt Coup!"
 ord.48.d:0 "Our attempt at strongarming the nobility has failed, and they have tried to seize power today! Though their attempt was pitiful, only securing them parts of the city of "
 ord.48.a:0 "We cannot afford a revolt at this time - let them have their luxuries."
 ord.48.b:0 "That's it! Send in the army."
 ord.49.t:0 "Coup Halted"
 ord.49.d:0 "The nobility's attempted coup has been crushed, the possessions of the rebellious and probably heretical traitors sold off to found a new temple in Ythelmare. Stability has been restored."
 ord.49.a:0 "Our plans advance."
 ord.50.t:0 "The Hofmeyer Question"
 ord.50.d:0 "Adalbrecht Hofmeyer, one of the Humans in our realm, has proven to be an incredibly competent administrator. He has risen far in the ranks of the government, being the personal aide of the recently-passed Governor of Ythelmare, and is now requesting we appoint him as the new Governor!"
 ord.50.a:0 "We must not waste potential, no matter its origin. Hofmeyer shall rule Ythelmare!"
 ord.50.b:0 "Never! The demi-Elves must know their place and be glad they are granted it!"
 ord.51.t:0 "Trial of the Five"
 ord.51.d:0 "Treason against the state in the highest circles of government! Several young nobles, including son of the King and heir to the throne Larennis Valinthir, have been discovered hiding vermin from the authorities! The Traditionalists demand the death penalty, but the King is pulling all the strings he can to save his son. What shall their fate be?"
 ord.51.a:0 "Larennis Valinthir and his compatriots are acquitted!"
 ord.51.b:0 "Larennis Valinthir and his compatriots are found guilty!"
 ord.52.t:0 "The Resderin Conclave"
 ord.52.d:0 "Religious officials from across the country have gathered today to discuss a matter that has almost split the Church in twain: should the Moderate faction, which advocates co-existence with the vermin in a segregated society, be declared heretical and an affront to our Holy Church?"
 ord.52.a:0 "The Moderates spit on the holy Elven image - they are heretics!"
 ord.52.b:0 "They are still elves - the Moderates are not heretical!"
 ord.53.t:0 "Succesful Raid!"
 ord.53.d:0 "Our policy of sanctioned privateering is paying off! Today, a small fleet of raiding ships sailed into port, laden with wealth from distant ports!"
 ord.53.a:0 "To the victor go the spoils!"
 ord.54.t:0 "The Rebellion Crushed Once More!"
 ord.54.d:0 "The Second Rthaur Revolution ended the same way the first did - humiliating defeat for the rebels. Their ringleaders have been dragged into Quellion's central square and were all beheaded in a display of Ordorian might. There are a few guerillia cells left in the jungles, but they will all be found and put to the sword in time."
 ord.54.a:0 "Final victory over the rebels is ours!"
 ord.55.t:0 "Hysbryn on the Move!"
 ord.55.d:0 "It seems the Humans of Hysbryn, or 'Holzbrenn' in their barbaric tongue, have designs on our lands! Our spies have reported that their armies are exercising for an invasion of our South-Western territories, with the goal of driving us from Tholder Bay!"
 ord.55.a:0 "First Schwarzenbach, and now this? Alert the troops!"
 ord.56.t:0 "Moderate Victory!"
 ord.56.d:0 "The civil war has been brutal and harsh on our people, but we stand triumphant, the purple flag of King Valinthir flown high over Istaroth once more. The King himself and his son and heir to the throne, Laurennis Valinthir, led the final assault on the last Puritan stronghold. The Traditionalist resistance has been shattered, and Lothinnys has been tried and executed as a traitor. The authority of the Moderates now stands unquestioned."
 ord.56.a:0 "Glory to King Valinthir!"
 ord.57.t:0 "Traditionalist Victory!"
 ord.57.d:0 "The civil war has been brutal and harsh on our people, but total victory over the Moderates and their sickening tolerance of the vermin has been assured as last. The King was placed under house arrest after trying to flee aboard a ship from Ythelmare, but his son, Laurennis, is still unaccounted for. Regardless, Traditionalist authority has been restored in Ordoria."
 ord.57.a:0 "Down with the lesser races and their Moderate cronies!"
 ord.58.t:0 "The Future of Ordoria"
 ord.58.d:0 "With the Moderate threat quashed, the old squabbles between the Traditionalists and the Faithful have flared up again. While they agree on the end goal of Elven supremacy, they are still in disgreement on how to achieve this goal. An impromptu meeting has been called in Istaroth to decide the course Ordorian politics should take."
 ord.58.a:0 "We shall lead Ordoria to glory and purity."
 ska.1.t:0 "Ordoria Threatens Us!"
 ska.1.d:0 "An envoy from the Ordorians have arrived today, delivering a threat in no uncertain terms: either we renounce our alliance with Rthauiaur, or they will not stop until our Freehold is in ruins and the last family has been tossed off the cliffs."
 ska.1.a:0 "It is a difficult choice, but we cannot risk the destruction of our people."
 ska.1.b:0 "A plague on Istaroth! We stand with our friends, especially against such maniacs!"
 ska.2.t:0 "Ordoria Offers Peace"
 ska.2.d:0 "An Ordorian emissary appeared at our gate today, waving the white flag. It appears Ordoria would be content to end the fighting now, as they have retaken Rthauiaur. Though it would guarantee our safety, at least for the time being, it would also condemn our Rthaur allies to suffering under the Ordorian boot..."
 ska.2.a:0 "There is no dishonour in conceding defeat in a lost war. Agree to the peace."
 ska.2.b:0 "Never - we shall liberate Quellion and march right on to Istaroth!"
 ska.3.t:0 "Peace with Ordoria?"
 ska.3.d:0 "Our Rthaur allies have fallen and our proud capital is in the hands of the Ordorians. Reports of atrocities and the destruction of ancient works of art and holy relics are already filing in from refugees - perhaps we should bend the knee to Ordoria and concede defeat?"
 ska.3.a:0 "We must swallow our pride and admit defeat."
 ska.3.b:0 "Stomp out these defeatist thoughts!"
 ska.4.t:0 "Ordoria Accepts!"
 ska.4.d:0 "Our diplomats have returned, bearing good news - Ordoria has accepted our offer of peace! Yet, this news is received with little warmth at court - we might have peace, but our people still lay massacred, our buildings destroyed and the tombs of our ancestors desecrated."
 ska.4.a:0 "Vae victis."
 ska.5.t:0 "Ordoria Demands Concessions"
 ska.5.d:0 "Ordoria's diplomats have made clear that they are willing to end the war if we accept some border adjustments. It seems Ordoria wants to put some mountains between them and our vengeance."
 ska.5.a:0 "It is this peace or the peace of the grave."
 ska.5.b:0 "A true Dwarf will die before losing their honour! We will fight to the end!"
 ska.6.t:0 "Ordoria Declines!"
 ska.6.d:0 "The grim mood at court grew even gloomier when our haggard diplomats walked in. Their sorrowful eyes betrayed the message they had before they said a word - Ordoria has rejected our offer of peace."
 ska.6.a:0 "A fight to the end it is, then."
 ska.7.t:0 "Ordoria Demands Vassalage!"
 ska.7.d:0 "Ordoria's diplomats have offered us peace, but at the cost of our sovereignty - they demand we submit as a vassal state!"
 ska.7.a:0 "At least they're just imperialists now, instead of genocidal maniacs..."
 ska.7.b:0 "Dwarves, bowing to an Elf? Never!"
 ska.8.t:0 "The Second Rthaur Revolution"
 ska.8.d:0 "It seems the Ordorians could not break the armies of our allies, but not their spirit. Across Ordorian territory, Rosites are rising up in what is called the 'Second Rthaur Revolution'. An envoy of these revolutionaries has come to our court today, imploring us to aid their cause once more."
 ska.8.a:0 "A Dwarf never forgets a friend - Rthauiaur calls for aid, and Skaelinger shall answer!"
 ska.8.b:0 "We wish them the best, but another war would spell doom for us. They are on their own."
 ska.8.c:0 "It is tragic, but our obligations to our liege prevent us from helping."
 ska.9.t:0 "Rthauiaur Falls!"
 ska.9.d:0 "Our allies in Rthauiaur have fallen to the Ordorian ontslaught! Our troops have scattered into the jungles and made their way home to reconsolidate and defend our mountain halls!"
 ska.9.a:0 "Fall back and defend, enemy coming!"
 rth.1.t:0 "Ordorian Influence"
 rth.1.d:0 "Our inability to properly patrol our borders is hurting our cause severely, as it appears that Ordoria is sending over warriors, equipment and propaganda to assist sympathisers to their despicable cause in preparing for a coup against the government! We must aim to secure our borders and root out these cells, lest they send our country into another destructive civil war!"
 rth.1.a:0 "Damn them!"
 rth.2.t:0 "Pro-Ordorian Coup!"
 rth.2.d:0 "Our worst fears have come true today - across the sympathisers, Ordoria's sympathisers are rising up in arms to overthrow our rightful government! Fortunately, it appears that many of our loyal citizens have taken what arms they can find and risen to defend the revolution, but the situation looks dire indeed..."
 rth.2.a:0 "For the sake of our people, we must not lose this war!"
 rth.2.b:0 "At long last, we can cast off the shackles of the xeno-lovers!"
 rth.3.t:0 "Skaelinger Abandons Us!"
 rth.3.d:0 "A message from the Free Stronghold arrived, looking rather downtrodden, even ashamed. We soon found out why. Under Ordorian pressure, our 'steadfast' allies in the mountains have rescinded their protection of us - we will have to face the Ordorian onslaught alone!"
 rth.3.a:0 "Damn those Dwarves!"
 rth.4.t:0 "War with Ordoria!"
 rth.4.d:0 "Whether we are ready or not, the civil war has flared up to full-scale war once more. The fate of our people will be decided at last."
 rth.4.a:0 "To arms!"
 rth.5.t:0 "The Revolution Triumphant!"
 rth.5.d:0 "Though they tried and tried again, the genocidal despots in Ordoria could not break our people's indomitable spirit! Our brave soldiers have shattered the Ordorian troops, and the Bread-and-Rose Banner now flies from the keep of Istaroth!"
 rth.5.a:0 "The people victorious, now and forever more!"
 rth.6.t:0 "Loris Pass Lost!"
 rth.6.d:0 "The Loris Pass, the only easily traversable route between Quellion and Thurgithon, has been lost to the enemy! This is a major setback, as our military communications are disrupted and our country is split in two halves."
 rth.6.a:0 "Damnation!"
 rth.7.t:0 "Loris Pass Regained"
 rth.7.d:0 "We have retaken the Loris pass, and held against the enemy's counter-attack! Military communications are back to normal, though civilian travel is, obviously, still limited."
 rth.7.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 rth.8.t:0 "Loris Pass Unnecessary"
 rth.8.d:0 "A trickle of survivors have crossed into the half of our country we still control, through the mountains or through enemy lines. All share the same message; the other half of our country has fallen. At least we don't have to worry about communication issues anymore..."
 rth.8.a:0 "That's... good?"
 rth.9.t:0 "Alucien Found Dead!"
 rth.9.d:0 "Terrible news has struck our nation today. When the secretaries of state sent a messenger to Derathur's house, inquiring why he was late to today's meeting, he was found brutally murdered in his bed! The Burning Tree of Ordoria was branded into his forehead. The new Prime Speaker has already been sworn in, but the nation is in deep mourning."
 rth.9.a:0 "A dark day for our nation."
 rth.10.t:0 "Alucien Murdered!"
 rth.10.d:0 "The vile Ordorians have killed Alucien Derathur, the Hero of the Revolution, in his bed, like the cowards they are! Rthaur workers throughout the nation are crying out for blood, and people are signing up for the army in droves!"
 rth.10.a:0 "We must wipe these barbaric murderers from the face of the planet!"
 rth.11.t:0 "Skaelinger Joins Us!"
 rth.11.d:0 "It was wise to call upon our historical allies - Skaelinger has reaffirmed the bond our nation shares, and has agreed to take up arms against the evil of Ordoria alongside us for a second time!"
 rth.11.a:0 "Once more into the breach!"
 rth.12.t:0 "Skaelinger Refuses to Join Us"
 rth.12.d:0 "Though we had hoped Skaelinger would be willing to fight alongside us once more, our messenger came back with ill news today - Skaelinger won't join us! They're still devastated from the last war, and fear another might spell their extinction."
 rth.12.a:0 "It appears we're on our own this time."
 rth.13.t:0 "Skaelinger Cannot Join Us"
 rth.13.d:0 "Though we had hoped Skaelinger could take up arms alongside us yet again, our envoy has returned empty-handed; citing responsibilities to their overlords, Skaelinger informed us they can sadly not join our war."
 rth.13.a:0 "First we destroy Ordoria, then we liberate our comrades!"
 gmr.1.t:0 "Ordorian Overtures"
 gmr.1.d:0 "Our border guards were taken by surprise this morning as an Ordorian delegation came riding out of the jungles, waving the white flag. Apparently, there's been a rather radical shift in attitude in Ordoria's government, and we are now being approached with a proposal: if we pledge to assist Ordoria in putting down the Rthaur rebellion, they are willing to sign a pact of non-aggression with us. What should we do?"
 gmr.1.a:0 "Securing our Southern border would free up troops for our Rimatü campaign - sign the pact!"
 gmr.1.b:0 "Around Elves, watch yourselves - there shall be no such treaty!"
 gmr.2.t:0 "Ordoria Formalizes the Pact"
 gmr.2.d:0 "An envoy from our friends to the South has arrived - they have worked out the final details, and they are ready to formalize our alliance. We have been invited to send a delegation to the port city of Ythelmare to finalize the creation of the pact."
 gmr.2.a:0 "Excellent! Send our most respected diplomats to Ythelmare!"
 gmr.3.t:0 "Ordoria Breaks the Pact"
 gmr.3.d:0 "Citing the defeat of the Rthaur rebellion, the Ordorians have informed us that our alliance has 'outlived its usefulness'. Ordoria considers all treaties between us null and void, and scouts have reported Ordorian troop movements at our border!"
 gmr.3.a:0 "Damn those treacherous Elves!"
 gmr.4.t:0 "Ordoria Seizes Sothane!"
 gmr.4.d:0 "Word has reached us that Ordorian troops have swiftly marched on the small Duchy of Sothane, taking the soldiers there by complete surprise! Sothane is now firmly under Ordorian control..."
 gmr.4.a:0 "Assemble the generals - this means war!"
 gmr.4.b:0 "We must back down for now."
 gmr.5.t:0 "Arthenon Assassinated!"
 gmr.5.d:0 "Terrible news! The Grand Master has been assassinated by an outlaw Noctheurge today. The military has stepped in to maintain order, but the situation is dire..."
 gmr.5.a:0 "Sing of his final stand, long live Trabaster..."
 gmr.6.t:0 "The Realm Shatters!"
 gmr.6.d:0 "The death of the Grand Master, the takeover by the Kingsmen Rebels and now Jace's coup has proven too much to handle for the Realm - the country has shattered, with the natives in every major city driving out the nobility that landed with Arthenon and declaring independence!"
 gmr.6.a:0 "Ierethayne, first nation to fall to the Tyrant, will be the first freed!"
 gmr.6.b:0 "Felweyne, heart of the inland trade of the Northern Plains, will rise once more!"
 gmr.6.c:0 "Kortinall, city of woodworkers, is free at last!"
 gmr.6.e:0 "No, we shall lead another nation..."
 gmr.7.t:0 "Ordorian Raids"
 gmr.7.d:0 "It seems Ordoria is on the move - the village of Dorissus has been put to the torch! Though not many people died, it will take a while to repair the damage..."
 gmr.7.a:0 "Damn them!"
 gmr.8.t:0 "Noble Assassinated!"
 gmr.8.d:0 "The royal court was in shock today, as word reached us a prominent local noble has been assassinated! All signs point to this being the work of Ordoria."
 gmr.8.a:0 "Tragic."
 gmr.9.t:0 "Ordorian Terror Campaign!"
 gmr.9.d:0 "People out late at night are found the next morning as horribly mutilated corpses, children are stolen from their beds, and tortured shrieks can be heard throughout the night. All signs point to Ordoria being behind this."
 gmr.9.a:0 "Double the watch! Nay, triple it!"
 gmr.10.t:0 "Ordorian Meddling"
 gmr.10.d:0 "A disturbing pattern of assassinations, riots and blackmail has come to our attention as of late. It appears that there is a conspiracy in the works with the goal of shattering our Union! All signs point to Ordoria..."
 gmr.10.a:0 "Damn those Elves!"
 gmr.11.t:0 "Separatist Uprisings!"
 gmr.11.d:0 "Funded by foreign groups - all traces leading back to the Ordorians - separatist movements across the nation have risen up! They are well-organized, and if not quickly stopped could bring the entire Realm come crashing down!"
 gmr.11.a:0 "Do everything in our power to stop the separatists!"
 gmr.12.t:0 "Irenthar Remains Loyal"
 gmr.12.d:0 "Though even the capital had to deal with some uprisings, the city's status as capital meant that any such revolt was doomed from the start. Arthenon himself led the charge against the last separatist stronghold, and the heads of the movement's leaders now jut from spikes in front of the gates of the city."
 gmr.12.a:0 "We hold Irenthar. This means not everything is lost."
 gmr.13.t:0 "Irenthar Revolts!"
 gmr.13.d:0 "The separatists have made gains beyond their wildest dreams - Irenthar itself has fallen to the rebels! Arthenon has fled the city, and the Blacksteel Throne has been paraded through the city before being tossed into the harbour. The situation is dire."
 gmr.13.a:0 "We built the city too well - we cannot take it by storm. We must regroup and prepare for siege."
 gmr.13.b:0 "If the capital falls, all is lost - send all available men to retake Irenthar!"
 gmr.14.t:0 "Felwerin Remains Loyal"
 gmr.14.d:0 "Good news! We have received reports from the Enforcers of Felwerin that they have quelled the uprising there. Martial law has been declared, and the city stands ready to aid us in defeating the uprisings!"
 gmr.14.a:0 "The heart of the Northern Plains remains in our hands."
 gmr.15.t:0 "Felwerin Revolts!"
 gmr.15.d:0 "At dawn, a single horseman rode into the city, slumped on his horse with an arrow in his shoulder. It was one of Felwerin's Enforcers, having ridden non-stop for three nights and three days to bring us word that the city has fallen to separatists!"
 gmr.15.a:0 "Regrettable, but the open plains of Felwerin would have been impossible to hold anyway."
 gmr.15.b:0 "Felwerin is the key to controlling the Plains - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.16.t:0 "Cortineal Remains Loyal"
 gmr.16.d:0 "The Enforcers in our city of Cortineal have sent word that they have beaten down all separatist movements in the city! Some isolated rebels remain in the thick woodlands surrounding the city, but they should not prove any threat to our control of the region."
 gmr.16.a:0 "Our Southern border is secure!"
 gmr.17.t:0 "Cortineal Revolts!"
 gmr.17.d:0 "Terrible news! After a sustained campaign of guerillia warfare from both the woodlands in the countryside and the slums in the city, Cortineal has fallen to the separatists!"
 gmr.17.a:0 "That is a disappointment, but we cannot do anything right now."
 gmr.17.b:0 "We cannot lose their timber supplies - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.18.t:0 "Nastrogdar Remains Loyal"
 gmr.18.d:0 "The Enforcers in Nastrogdar have beaten down a peasant's uprising, and the city stands ready to defend the Realm!"
 gmr.18.a:0 "We won't have to worry about our food supplies, then!"
 gmr.19.t:0 "Nastrogdar Revolts!"
 gmr.19.d:0 "Nastrogdar has fallen to a peasant rebellion! The serfs have put the many aristocratic manors in the countryside to the torch and taken control of the city!"
 gmr.19.a:0 "They're too far away from our secured territory. We'll have to pacify them later."
 gmr.19.b:0 "We msut secure our food supply - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.20.t:0 "Caltireth Remains Loyal"
 gmr.20.d:0 "We have received word that Caltireth's loyalty has not wavered! There were some scuffles in the foundries and the mines, but the nobility's troops have put these all down."
 gmr.20.a:0 "Looks like we'll have all the equipment we need to put down these uprisings."
 gmr.21.t:0 "Caltireth Revolts!"
 gmr.21.d:0 "Ill tidings from the East today - Caltireth has declared independence! The nobility has cited the lack of stability in the Realm as the reasaon, proclaiming that we have failed in our obligation to defend them and as such all feudal ties are dissolved."
 gmr.21.a:0 "Without me, those ungrateful bastards would have been rotting away in Eokgi slave ships!"
 gmr.21.b:0 "We must secure the smithies of Kaltire - send in the Enforcers!"
 gmr.22.t:0 "Trifersi Remains Loyal"
 gmr.22.d:0 "Many in our government feared that Trifersi, ever a hub of rebels and other scum, would fall to the separatists, but it seems the local Enforcers acted swiftly to calm the situation down. Martial law has been declared and the gallows are rich with traitor corpses."
 gmr.22.a:0 "Finally some good news for once..."
 gmr.23.t:0 "Trifersi Revolts!"
 gmr.23.d:0 "It seems we were not thorough enough with rooting out the Enstlas dynasty - a young man purporting to be the heir to the Last King has rallied the citizenry and driven out our forces!"
 gmr.23.a:0 "Gah! Do I have to commit every act of regicide myself?!"
 gmr.23.b:0 "Tell the Enforcers to go back in there and do their job properly this time."
 gmr.24.t:0 "Navandon Remains Loyal"
 gmr.24.d:0 "The Navy has proven to be worth its weight in gold today; our sailors have marched from their ships and put down the budding revolutionaries in Navandon!"
 gmr.24.a:0 "We must see the captains responsible get a pay rise."
 gmr.25.t:0 "Navandon Revolts!"
 gmr.25.d:0 "It seems we cannot trust our Navy - the sailors have defected to the separatists en mass, made their captains walk the plank, and declared independence as a Pirate Kingdom under a self-styled Admiral!"
 gmr.25.a:0 "This is purely a land battle. The Navy is of no concern for now."
 gmr.25.b:0 "Time to exploit the Army-Navy rivalry; send in the troops to put down this uprising!"
 gmr.26.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Irenthar"
 gmr.26.d:0 "It was a wise decision to send the Enforcers to retake the capital - Irenthar is once again ours! The Blacksteel Throne has been dredged from the ocean, and a reign of terror by the Enforcers is currently making sure the population never again considers stepping out of line."
 gmr.26.a:0 "The capital is safe. Now, to restore order in the rest of the Realm."
 gmr.27.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Irenthar"
 gmr.27.d:0 "Ill tidings - it turns out we made our capital too well-defended. The Enforcers have tried to take the city by storm, but the citizenry took to the walls and has repelled every attack. Without the numbers for a siege, the Enforcers returned to our current headquarters with heavy losses."
 gmr.27.a:0 "Damnation!"
 gmr.28.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Felwerin"
 gmr.28.d:0 "Our rapid response to the situation in Felwerin has borne fruit - the city is once again in our hands!"
 gmr.28.a:0 "The heartland of the Plains is secure once again."
 gmr.29.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Felwerin"
 gmr.29.d:0 "Sadly, our Enforcers have failed to take Felwerin by surprise. The remaining Enforcers in the city have been bribed by the separatists and are now unwilling to help us sneak into the city. We will have to abandon Felwerin for now."
 gmr.29.a:0 "We will return, and they will pay!"
 gmr.30.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Cortineal"
 gmr.30.d:0 "Excellent news - our Enforcers have retaken Cortineal! Already supplies of timber are flowing into the city again, replenishing our critically low stocks."
 gmr.30.a:0 "This should make the fletchers happy..."
 gmr.31.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Cortineal"
 gmr.31.d:0 "Our advance force has failed to retake Cortineal! This leaves our southern borders dangerously exposed to Ordorian advances..."
 gmr.31.a:0 "Damnation!"
 gmr.32.t:0 "The Realm Shatters!"
 gmr.32.d:0 "Which country shall we lead?"
 gmr.32.a:0 "Navandonne, the base of the Realm's Navy, shall set sail for a Golden Age!"
 gmr.32.b:0 "Nastrodoge, breadbasket of the Northern Plains, shall be ascendant!"
 gmr.32.c:0 "Kaltire's foundries shall pave the way to greatness!"
 gmr.32.e:0 "No, let us rule from elsewhere..."
 gmr.33.t:0 "The Realm Shatters!"
 gmr.33.d:0 "Which country shall we lead?"
 gmr.33.a:0 "Trifell, last to fall, shall be the first to rise from the ashes!"
 gmr.33.b:0 "We shall not give up on the ambitions of the Grand Master!"
 gmr.33.c:0 "No, we must govern from another city."
 gmr.34.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Nastrogdar!"
 gmr.34.d:0 "The Enforcers we sent to pacify the farmers of Nastrogdar have been bled dry by a sustained campaign of harassment, and when they arrived at the city they were laughed off by the defenders. It seems our efforts to retake the Realm's breadbasket have failed."
 gmr.34.a:0 "Curses!"
 gmr.35.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Nastrogdar"
 gmr.35.d:0 "Our Enforcers have marched into Nastrogdar, fighting off the occasional group of disorganized farmers, and have retaken the city with little effort."
 gmr.35.a:0 "Excellent news!"
 gmr.36.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Caltireth"
 gmr.36.d:0 "Our armies have successfully retaken the foundries of Caltireth, and the rebellious nobles have surrendered. They are now locked in their own prisons!"
 gmr.36.a:0 "Our supply of arms is secured."
 gmr.37.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Caltireth"
 gmr.37.d:0 "The Caltiran nobility has unfortunately had the bright idea to arm their troops with the weapons and armour from their foundries. This has helped them beat back our troops!"
 gmr.37.a:0 "Damnation!"
 gmr.38.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Trifersi"
 gmr.38.d:0 "The Enforcers have finally done their job - the corpse of the last heir of the Enstlas Dynasty now hangs from the gates of the city, and the rebellion is broken at last!"
 gmr.38.a:0 "Good news!"
 gmr.39.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Trifersi"
 gmr.39.d:0 "The citizens of Trifersi continue to defy us - they have fought off the troops we sent in to quash the rebellion, and they now stand ready to march on our territory!"
 gmr.39.a:0 "Curses!"
 gmr.40.t:0 "Enforcers Restore Order in Navandon"
 gmr.40.d:0 "The Navy has shown why it should stick to the seas - our troops have easily shattered their resistance and put down the rebellion!"
 gmr.40.a:0 "The generals responsible should be promoted!"
 gmr.41.t:0 "Failed Suppression in Navandon"
 gmr.41.d:0 "The rebellious sailors have beaten back our troops sent in to retake our rightful lands!"
 gmr.41.a:0 "I knew we should have just given them those oranges..."

 gmr.43.t:0 "The Kingsmen Rebellion"
 gmr.43.d:0 "Rumours of discontent and sedition are nothing new to the Enforcers, but unrest has reached a boiling point as of late. A young Half-Elven peasant from the farms of Nastrodoge claims he was told by the false gods of the native populace that he was destined to rule the Northern Plains, and he has been assembling an army of traitors for years. It seems that he finally felt ready to raise his banner in open revolt, and several cities have already fallen to his rebellion!"

 gmr.46.d:0 "Though for most of the duration of the Conquest, our generals-turned-nobility remained unified behind the Sothrist faith of our homeland, some were so awestruck by Arthenon's might that they began to whisper rumours of the Grand Master being more than human. Eventually, these seeds grew into a cult and then a fully-fledged, if fringe, religion. This religion has spread amongst the nobility, and even some of the natives. It has, in fact, grown so popular that the Juridity of Benevolence has openly declared itself Arthenist and is pushing for the faith to be made the state religion! This is doubtlessly a move by the High Juritor of Benevolence to increase his power, but we must nonetheless decide a course of action."
 gmr.46.a:0 "We will have to consider this development."
 gmr.47.t:0 "Religious Struggles"
 gmr.47.d:0 "With the recent declaration by the Juridity of Benevolence, religious tensions in our nation have come to a head. The nobility is now bitterly divided between the Sothrists and the Arthenists, and the local faith is more and more becoming the crux of the resistance movement. We need to decide what religion will guide the Realm before this schismatism undoes all we have fought for!"
 gmr.47.a:0 "Muzma and Dibegar would strike us down if we abandoned them!"

The woodworkers of the capital's Carpenter's District have erected barricades and are pelting the city watch with mud, dung and bricks!"
 hlz.1.a:0 "They dare defy the will of their rightful master? Send in the army. Kill them all."
 hlz.2.t:0 "The Last Straw"
 hlz.2.d:0 "After the bloody suppression of the Carpenter's Strike, the Freiprinz ordered his men to arrest everyone with even the most tenous links to those involved. He then had everyone gathered up at the Altpalastplatz, under threat of death. The people's worst fears were realised when the Freiprinz announced the mass execution of everyone arrested!"
 hlz.2.a:0 "We must not stand for this! To arms, citizens! Depose the Freiprinz! End the Reign!"
 hlz.3.t:0 "Rosenblut Deposed"
 hlz.3.d:0 "The bloodbath at the Altpalastplatz was the spark that set off the gunpowder barrel - the entire country has revolted against the Mad Prince! Even as the nobility is gathering their levies to march on the capital and place the Mad Prince under arrest, the people are out in the streets, armed with whatever they can find, co-ordinated by the Libertines and the Solidarity League. The city watch has defected to the rebels, and it is now only a question of who will be the first to oust the Freiprinz and secure power in Holzbrenn."
 hlz.3.a:0 "The nobility seizes the capital as Rosenblut flees with his tail between his legs!"
 hlz.3.b:0 "The citizenry breaks down the doors of the Altpalast and send Rosenblut packing!"
 hlz.4.t:0 "The Council of Dukes"
 hlz.4.d:0 "With order restored in the capital, the armies of the nobility are sent across the country to secure the other cities, fortresses and strategic positions. Meanwhile, all important nobles, primarily Dukes and Duchesses, have assembled in the Altpalast to discuss the future of the Freiprinztum."
 hlz.4.a:0 "The office of Freiprinz must hencheforth be constrained by checks and balances!"
 hlz.4.b:0 "We must never again allow a tyrant to govern Holzbrenn."
 hlz.5.t:0 "The Cherry Revolution"
 hlz.5.d:0 "The nobility's army at the gates has been brought to a screeching halt by a stout defense by the people of Holzbrenn, and after some diplomatic talks, the aristocracy has formally handed power to the new Citizen's Assembly. Emergency elections have been scheduled, but there are only two factions with a realistic chance of victory - the mercantile Libertines and the radical Solidarity League."
 hlz.5.a:0 "The Libertines' promises of freedoms sway the people!"
 hlz.5.b:0 "The Solidarity League's support for minorities and peasants carries the day!"
 hlz.6.t:0 "Resolving the Famine"
 hlz.6.d:0 "With domestic stability secured and the various noble houses assembled at the Edlerrat, discussion has turned to dealing with the famine sweeping the country. Some young aristocrats have set up soup kitchens to feed the poor and are requesting government support for this, but Beckenbauer and his supporters are arguing for the strict rationing of what food is available to make sure everyone can at least survive."
 hlz.6.a:0 "The Suppenküchen deserve our support!"
 hlz.6.b:0 "We must husband our resources carefully."
 hlz.7.t:0 "The Question of the University"
 hlz.7.d:0 "Now that the most immediate problems with the famine have been addressed, the Edlerrat has turned its attention to the University of Holzbrenn. Under Rosenblut, only the aristocracy was allowed to enter, and it was little more than a facility to indoctrinate the ruling class into the ideas of the Mad Freiprinz. There is broad agreement that the University should be opened to everyone, but the question is how far this should go."
 hlz.7.a:0 "The University should be open to all members of society!"
 hlz.7.b:0 "We must only allow the brightest minds to study at our University."
 hlz.8.t:0 "Housing our People"
 hlz.8.d:0 "Now that the tumultous weeks of Rosenblut's ousting are behind us, the government is turning its attention towards more mundane matters. A lack of acceptable housing has long been a problem in Holzbrenn, leading to slums in the city and homelessness everywhere. Many nobles have offered to repurpose their mansions for the benefit of the people, but Beckenbauer is arguing for a more thorough Renovation Program."
 hlz.8.a:0 "Initiate the Renovierungsprogramm!"
 hlz.8.b:0 "Let us repurpose the mansions instead."
 hlz.9.t:0 "Choosing our Friends"
 hlz.9.d:0 "With daily life returned to normal, voices in the Edlerrat have been calling for the expansion of the council to include non-royalty. They are concerned that we will lose legitimacy and public support if we do not reach out to the common folk of Holzbrenn. All are in agreement that the Elves require a representative to help undo the damages done to Elf-Human relation by Rosenblut, but there is a division between the majority, who want to invite the Libertines, and some young aristocrats who want to talk with the Solidarity League."
 hlz.9.a:0 "The Libertines, of course."
 hlz.9.b:0 "We must talk with the League!"
 hlz.10.t:0 "The Rebirth of a Nation"
 hlz.10.d:0 "Our country has gone through many radical changes in the past weeks, and many philosophers have gone so far as to call it 'The Rebirth of Holzbrenn'. This has become very clear in parliament, where it has become clear that there is some division as to what direction our nation should take. Though everyone is committed to the ideals of liberty and equality, the Libertines argue that we should pursue prosperity for our people, while the League argues that justice ought to take precedence."
 hlz.10.a:0 "Prosperity shall ensure a bright future for everyone in Holzbrenn!"
 hlz.10.b:0 "Let there be liberty and justice for all!"
 hlz.11.t:0 "Dealing with Ordoria"
 hlz.11.d:0 "The Elves to our North have grown increasingly bellicose in recent years, and the civil war that has broken out a few years ago seems to be flaring up again. We will need to respond in some manner, though the government is divided - the Libertines want to welcome refugees but otherwise stay out of it, while the League wants to send volunteers to join the Rthaur in their struggle."
 hlz.11.a:0 "Let Holzbrenn be a beacon of liberty for any oppressed Ordorian."
 hlz.11.b:0 "We must not let the dark tide of Puritanism overwhelm our Rthaur friends!"
 hlz.12.t:0 "Pressler's Ambitions"
 hlz.12.d:0 "Worrying news - it appears that one of Rosenblut's supporters, one Marius Pressler, is assembling an army and staking a claim to conquer Holzbrenn! Decrying the new government as 'illegitimate', he is arguing his case in various Freiprinztümer and using the wealth of his family to hire thugs and mercenaries in preparation of a coup!"
 hlz.12.a:0 "We must argue the righteous nature of our cause in front of Church and Hochprinzessin."
 hlz.12.b:0 "Words will get us nowhere - a more violent response is necessary."
 hlz.13.t:0 "The Future of the Legal System"
 hlz.13.d:0 "Under Rosenblut, the law was nothing more than a tool with which to dispose of those that opposed the state. This clearly has to change, but there is discussion over the best way to ensure justice. The aristocrats desire a system of 'Wessen Nachlass, sein Gesetz', where the local ruler resolves legal concerns, but Beckenbauer and his allies are pushing for a depoliticized legal system, with independent judges."
 hlz.13.a:0 "The Lords will surely pass wise judgement as needed."
 hlz.13.b:0 "And independent judiciary serves our people best."
 hlz.14.t:0 "The Question of Legitimacy"
 hlz.14.d:0 "We might have managed to secure short-term stability after ousting Rosenblut, but the aristocracy is still strongly associated with the Mad Freiprinz in the eyes of the common man. If we are to prevent another Republican uprising, we will have to shore up popular support somehow."
 hlz.14.a:0 "The Church enjoys the people's trust, we should approach them!"
 hlz.14.b:0 "Our people aren't stupid - we can convince them with sound arguments."
 hlz.14.c:0 "Actions speak louder than words. Strengthen the economy, and loyalty will follow."
 hlz.15.t:0 "The Bauernherren"
 hlz.15.d:0 "During Rosenblut's reign, many of our people fled or sadly perished, whether through the brutality of the Mad Freiprinz's cronies, or the famine he instigated. This has led to a lot of land being uncultivated. In recent months, however, some farmers have been buying up or otherwise acquiring this unused land, leading to creations of large farm-estates headed by a wealthy 'Bauernherr', or 'Gentleman Farmer'. They have been buying out neighbouring farms, meaning many one-time smallholders are now labourers on a Bauernherr-estate or have migrated to the cities in hopes of a better life. This shift in our economic situation must be at least investigated by the government to insure no unexpected consequences harm our still-fragile society."
 hlz.15.a:0 "We will have to consider our approach carefully."
 hlz.16.t:0 "Dealing with the Bauernherren"
 hlz.16.d:0 "After discussing the matter of the Bauernherren, three camps have formed; the League has mostly rallied behind Helmut Goeth, advocating for the rights of the 'smallholders', farmers whose lands are just about enough to support themselves and their families; the wealthier farmers in the Assembly are backing Alexandra von Neureim, a Bauernfrau herself, and finally, a majority of the Libertines is espousing the ideas of Joachim Fügler and his concept of 'machen-lassen', letting the mechanisms of the market sort out our agricultural situation."
 hlz.16.a:0 "Frau von Neureim is in the right."
 hlz.16.b:0 "Fügler's ideas will bring us wealth!"
 hlz.16.c:0 "Goeht's plan has merit!"
 hlz.17.t:0 "Land Reform"
 hlz.17.d:0 "One of our biggest campaigning points is land reform; some people own enough land to support an entire village, while others have nothing but the clothes on their backs, forced to work for a pittance to stay alive. Everyone in the League agrees that this situation cannot stand, but we are divided in how to go about land redistribution. One of the League's most prominent organizers, Karl Stelzner, is pushing for state-owned farms, while Frau Katzmann, our spokesperson, advocates restricting the possession of land to smallholds. Finally, a Rthaur refugeed by the name of Ylcatra Isthyne advocates following the Rthaur model of communal farms."
 hlz.17.a:0 "Herr Stelzner has the correct plan."
 hlz.17.b:0 "We should benefit from the experiences of the Rthaur and follow Frau Isthyne's policies."
 hlz.17.c:0 "Frau Katzmann's approach is the best."
 hlz.18.t:0 "Fate of the Aristocracy"
 hlz.18.d:0 "The Republic has been firmly established in Holzbrenn, and Republican ideals are being disseminated among the populace. As our new system of governance demands equality of all, we clearly must do away with the feudal ruling class of the aristocracy. How should we deal with them?"
 hlz.18.a:0 "We can grant them titular titles to placate the Union."
 hlz.18.b:0 "They shall be introduced into Republican society as normal citizens."

More importantly, they have created a writing system for the Perkav language and taught most Chieftains, including Krell, as well as some administrators to read and write, so we can actually keep track of this data."

 prk.19.a:0 "This is excellent news!"
 prk.20.t:0 "The Coronation of King Wendelin"
 prk.20.d:0 "After all the reforms, both politically and administratively, we have finally arrived at a point where power is centralized and formalized enough to officially declare Wendelin the King of Perkavland! Some of the Chieftains, now Dukes, are murmuring discontent, but most have applauded this institutionalization of feudal relations as a means of cementing their power."

 prk.21.t:0 "The Union Offers Vassalage"
 prk.21.d:0 "Adalina's representatives have met with Krell today, offering him a Freithron.

Critics, however, fear that we may be dragged into pointless wars."
