 very_fertile_land:0 "Very Fertile Land\n§WThe fields of this region seem to provide ever bigger harvests, covered in endless golden fields of wheat, apples the size of a person's head, and livestock so fat it can barely move. Even the poorest, most wretched peasant can find three meals a day here.§!"
 fertile_land:0 "Fertile Land\n§WThrough good management or naturally rich soil, this region is quite fertile. Harvests are generally good, and famine is not a realistic prospect.§!"
 infertile_land:0 "Infertile Land\n§WWhether caused by overuse, poor administration or simply a naturally poor soil, this region isn't very agriculturally productive. Farmers struggle to produce a surplus, often barely eking out a meager existence. Importing food from elsewhere in the realm is probably necessary for survival.§!"
 very_infertile_land:0 "Very Infertile Land\n§WThrough a curse of the gods or just very hostile terrain, this region is incredibly infertile. Anyone that can so much as grow a single crop here should be hailed as a saint of agriculture. Sending food here from other parts of our realm is a must if anyone is to survive here.§!"
