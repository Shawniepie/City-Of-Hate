 GENERIC_nepotism_desc:0 "Our monarch's control of the government allows him to hand-pick the vast majority of the higher offices, and it would be only natural to put trusted and competent family members in charge. After all, blood is thicker than water."

 GENERIC_protests_streets_desc:0 "Our people are rioting in the streets, railing against the tyrants and the aristocrats in a bid to secure freedom for themselves! Word has reached us that even the city watch sent to deal with them has defected - the situation is getting out of hand!"

 GENERIC_rule_waves:0 "Rule the Waves"

 GENERIC_expand_dockyards:0 "Expand our Dockyards"
 GENERIC_expand_dockyards_desc:0 "Though we have seen an increase in ship production, it is not enough. We must put all our weight behind new shipbuilding initiatives."
 GENERIC_standardize_ships:0 "Standard Ship Patterns"
 GENERIC_standardize_ships_desc:0 "One of our boatwrights has had the ingenious idea of producing standardized plans for ships and mandate that ships be built acconrding to these plans. This is sure to streamline production."
 GENERIC_dominate_sea:0 "Dominate the Seas"
 GENERIC_dominate_sea_desc:0 "Though our army laments it, the interests of the navy come first. Without them, our trade would grind to a halt and our overseas interests would be laid to waste. The fleet is mightier than the sword."
 GENERIC_officers_curriculum:0 "Set the Curriculum for Officers"
 GENERIC_officers_curriculum_desc:0 "Though we are lucky to have talented generals, this has been due to chance rather than education. We need to decide what strategies suit our armed forces best, and create an Officer's Academy to teach this doctrine."
 GENERIC_trust_cavalry:0 "Trust in Cavalry"
 GENERIC_trust_cavalry_desc:0 "Flying across the battlefield like a butterfly and smashing into the enemy lines with the force of a sledgehammer, cavalry is excellent for mobile warfare. We must build our doctrines around cavalry."
 GENERIC_outriders:0 "Outrider Corps"
 GENERIC_outriders_desc:0 "Scouting is a demanding and difficult mission, and the attrition rate of scouts is very high. By creating a specialized Outrider Corps, we will have elite reconnaisance troops at our disposal."
 GENERIC_hammers_anvils:0 "Hammers and Anvils"
 GENERIC_hammers_anvils_desc:0 "Though the cavalry is the core of our army, we must not forget the humble infantryman. Let them hold the line while the cavalry smashes into the enemy's flanks like a thunderbolt."
 GENERIC_professional_army:0 "Professional Army"

 GENERIC_uniforms:0 "Provide Uniforms to Soldiers"
 GENERIC_uniforms_desc:0 "Historically, only officers have worn uniforms in our armies, primarily to look dapper while leading our troops.

 GENERIC_regiments:0 "Regimental Regulations"
 GENERIC_regiments_desc:0 "Soldiers have always been loosely formed up in groups based on where they came from, but we have not yet tapped into the potential benefits this provides. By providing regimental heraldry and encouraging the formations of regimental traditions and friendly rivalries, we can make our men proud of the unit they serve with."
 GENERIC_levies:0 "Rely on Levies"
 GENERIC_levies_desc:0 "A 'good' army is overrated. A superbly trained soldier will still die if you throw enough louts at him, and giving ten peasants spears is a lot cheaper than training and equipping one professional warrior. Besides, there's plenty more peasants where they came from."
 GENERIC_massproduce_weapons:0 "Mass-Produce Weapons"
 GENERIC_massproduce_weapons_desc:0 "We don't need 'perfect' weapons - you'll find that someone poked with a 'shoddy' spear will still die if the hole in his guts is big enough. We must find as many shortcuts in weapon production as possible - after all, quantity has a quality all of its own."
 GENERIC_supply_wagons:0 "Supply Wagons"
 GENERIC_supply_wagons_desc:0 "Our army is large, and it matters very little if we outnumber the foe by three to one if four-fifths of our army drops dead because of hunger or cold before the battle even begins. We must improve our logistical structures to ensure our troops get the supplies they need."
 GENERIC_superior_organisation:0 "Superior Organisation"
 GENERIC_superior_organisation_desc:0 "If properly led, an army can be far stronger than the sum of its parts. Effective strategies are a force multiplier in the military, and we should make sure none can beat us in organisation."
 GENERIC_officers:0 "Strict Requirements for Officers"
 GENERIC_officers_desc:0 "Even the best strategies are worth nothing if executed by an incompetent commander. We must make sure that our generals are the best of the best, and accept nothing less than perfection from our officer corps."
 GENERIC_chain_command:0 "Forge the Chain of Command"
 GENERIC_chain_command_desc:0 "Our soldiers are drilled to obey every command, no matter how hazardous to their personal safety. In our army, every person knows their place, and our strategies benefit from it."
 GMR_religious_dispute:0 "Settle the Religious Dispute"
 GMR_religious_dispute_desc:0 "There is much religious strife in the Realm - the nobility holds on to Sothrist the faith of our homeland, the Juridity of Benevolence is pushing the belief in Arthenon as a God-King, and the natives still cling to their old faiths. This conflict is destabilizing the Realm, which we cannot afford. We must make a decision on how to move forward."
 GMR_eokgite_orthodoxy:0 "Sothrist Dominance"
 GMR_eokgite_orthodoxy_desc:0 "The Arthenist effort has failed, and Sothrist remains the dominant faith in the Realm's upper classes. We must support Sothrist institutions in our country."

 GMR_revise_the_dialects_desc:0 "Though our homeland's religion remains the one true faith, there are several objections in the Dialects that warn of 'dangers' in dealing with Kalafites and Hielites, claiming they 'disturb the balance of nature'. Surely this is a mistake; they carry the blessings of Muzma and Dibegar more than any other."
 GMR_split_church:0 "Split off from the Church"
 GMR_split_church_desc:0 "Our core religious tenets have been shifted, to the point that some within our faith say that we should break away from the cowardly Sothrist Church entirely. The Dasalmids are the holy emissaries of Muzma and Dibegar, and they deserve honouring as such - no matter what the false priests in Eokgi say!"
 GMR_codify_rituals:0 "Codify Rituals of Summoning"
 GMR_codify_rituals_desc:0 "Now that the religious barriers to dealings with Dasalmids have been removed, we should codify standardized Rites of Summoning, to ensure the safe handling of the summoned creatures."
 GMR_encourage_pacts:0 "Encourage Pacts with Dasalmids"
 GMR_encourage_pacts_desc:0 "Kalafites and Hielites can provide powerful boons - be it wisdom, might or courage. We should encourage our generals to make pacts with these holy beings and "
 GMR_forbid_commoners:0 "Bar Plainsmen from the Temples"
 GMR_forbid_commoners_desc:0 "We will never get the natives of the Northern Plains to see the true faith, but that matters not - let them cling to their superstitions! They are not worthy to receive the blessings of the Kalafites and Hielites and should be banned from practicing our faith."
 GMR_underground_churches:0 "Tolerate Underground Churches"
 GMR_underground_churches_desc:0 "We do not want the Plainsmen in our churches, and while we're not going to allow them to openly worship their false gods either, we can turn a blind eye to local religious practices held in secret."

 GMR_religious_detente_desc:0 ""
 GMR_arthenism_triumphant:0 "Arthenism Triumphant"
 GMR_arthenism_triumphant_desc:0 "The Juridity of Benevolence's arguments for the divinity of the Grand Master have taken hold, and more and more nobles are converting to the Arthenist faith! We should seize this opportunity with both hands and declare Arthenism our state religion."

 GMR_embrace_lorthoris_desc:0 "Though the more zealous of our upper class warn that our gods will destroy us or insist upon Arthenon's divinity, we must keep a level head and embrace the political reality of our situation - if we do not embrace the local faith, we will never truly be accepted as legitimate rulers by the locals."
 GMR_reopen_circles:0 "Reopen the Circles"
 GMR_reopen_circles_desc:0 "During the Unification, we tore down the many religious circles of trees, fungi, or even obelisks, to prevent worhip of local deities. With our embracement of the native religion, we should rebuild and reopen these Circles for service."

 UNG_tax_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks for Schneefilde"

 UNG_bigger_fish_desc:0 "Many in the Union see the sack of Schneefilde as a chance to finally crush the thorn in our side that is Perkavland, but we have very little to gain and much to lose from such a campaign. Instead of spending a large portion of our resources in a fight over some frozen wastelands, we should focus on our main rivals on the continent."
 UNG_concessions_territory:0 "Territorial Concessions"
 UNG_concessions_territory_desc:0 "Schneefilde is one of the largest Freiprinztümer, but its lands are unproductive. That being said, its meager fields are still lands of plenty compared to Perkavland's wastelands. If we prod Kolb into conceding some lands to Perkavland, we stand a good chance of ending the raids."
 UNG_resettle_migrants:0 "Resettle Migrants"

He rightfully recognizes that his position is only as secure as it is due to us, and he has offered us full military support against whatever foes we may face. We ought to reply in kind."
 UNG_vassalize_perkavland:0 "Offer Krell a Prinzthron"
 UNG_vassalize_perkavland_desc:0 "Our massive investments in Perkav has given us quite a bit of influence in Krell's Hall, and Krell himself is deeply indebted to us. If we word the proposal carefully, we just might be able to convince Krell to bend the knee and swear fealty to the Hochprinzessin as a new Freiprinz!"
 UNG_end_raids:0 "No More Raids"
 UNG_end_raids_desc:0 "Despite much opposition from those that proposed different solutions, we have forged ahead and once and for all ended the raids from Perkavland! Whatever ships henceforth set sail from Krell's Hall shall be ships of commerce, not ships of war."

 ORD_autumn:0 "The Autumn Debate"
 ORD_autumn_desc:0 "Though our people stand united in our hatred for the rebels in the East, we are divided still on many things. Let us organize a summit in Varinthia to decide the future course of our nation."
 ORD_thaw:0 "The Ordorian Thaw"
 ORD_thaw_desc:0 "The impossible has happened, and the Traditionalists and Faithful have been outmaneuvered by the Moderate faction at court. Our policy of racial discrimination has brought us nothing but enemies on all sides, while what we need is at the very least temporary allies against the poisonous ideologues of Rthauiaur!"
 ORD_approach_union:0 "Approach the Union"
 ORD_approach_union_desc:0 "Though the men of Stahlhof have been enroaching on our territory, and we intend to take back what is ours in the long run, our losses to the Principality pale in comparison to the devastation the Radicals have wrought. Let us approach the High Princess, and see if we can work out a temporary compromise."
 ORD_approach_realm:0 "Approach the Realm"
 ORD_approach_realm_desc:0 "In a mere five years - the blink of an eye, really - Arthenon has unified the men of the Northern Plains. His is a force to be reckoned with. For now, let us seek friendship - unleashing the Black Gargoyle on the Eastern rebels would swing the odds greatly in our favour."
 ORD_anti_radical_pact:0 "Cordon Sanitaire Against Radicals"
 ORD_anti_radical_pact_desc:0 "With our neighbours mollified for the time being, and our shared interests in containing the threat of Rosism, some of our advisors have propose a three-way alliance to bring down the Radical Republicans. Let's see if Irenthar and Faustburg are interested."
 ORD_break_pact:0 "Break the Pact"
 ORD_break_pact_desc:0 "Though our co-operation with the Realm and the Union has been fruitful and on occasion even pleasant, we cannot neglect the political realities of the situation. The pact was never more than a temporary alliance of convenience, and our generals are eager to carry out the plans we have for our neighbours to the North and South."
 ORD_pure_empire:0 "Empire of Purity"
 ORD_pure_empire_desc:0 "Throughout the debates, the Puritan faction has retained the upper hand. We have proven Elven superiority time and time again, and we shall not stray from our course."
 ORD_elven_supremacy:0 "Elven Supremacy"
 ORD_elven_supremacy_desc:0 "It is plainly obvious that the other races of the world are inferior compared to the perfection of the Elf. Let us instil in our people a sense of pride, and let them strive to be perfect examples of Elven flawlessness."
 ORD_self_reliance:0 "Self-Reliance"
 ORD_self_reliance_desc:0 "The bizarre fact that our neighbours do not see our perfection and somehow dare to object to our policy of expelling vermin means we could not import their inferior goods even if we wanted to. We must rely on peerless Elven goods of our own make instead."
 ORD_manifest_destiny:0 "Manifest Destiny"
 ORD_manifest_destiny_desc:0 "There are many lands out there, unsettled save for some vermin, barely deserving of more consideration than muck on one's boot. As the majestic jungle overtakes the inferior plains, so too must we settle the lands claimed by the vermin. It shall be so."
 ORD_pure_priests:0 "Priesthood of Purity"
 ORD_pure_priests_desc:0 "Though we were correct in our assertion of superiority, we neglected the spiritual parts of our doctrine. We have been gifted our supremacy by the Seven, and we must honour them as the purest of all."
 ORD_holy_superiority:0 "Holy Superiority"
 ORD_holy_superiority_desc:0 "The weaklings of the South worship a paltry imitation of our true gods, the Dwarven filth pays respects to rotting corpses, and the Northlings consider their upstart Master a god. Their faiths are as inferior as they themselves are, and we shall remind our people of their superior faith."
 ORD_puritan_crusade:0 "Crusade Against the Lesser Species"
 ORD_puritan_crusade_desc:0 "Our war against the vermin should not be seen, as some claim, as a mere war of conquest and settlement. It is a holy duty, and it must be treated as such."
 ORD_divine_right:0 "Claim Our Divine Right"
 ORD_divine_right_desc:0 "The signs of the diviners are clear; the lands beyond our jungles are ours to take. Bless the troops and chant the prayers of war, for the Extermination Crusade shall commence."
 ORD_reassert_eastern_claims:0 "Reassert Eastern Claims"
 ORD_reassert_eastern_claims_desc:0 "With our internal problems sorted out, it's time to turn our eyes to the rebellion in the East. Our generals have worked around the clock to create strategies; it's time to put them to use."
 ORD_shadow_war:0 "The Shadow War"
 ORD_shadow_war_desc:0 "A direct application of massive force is, while effective, prohibitively expensive in terms of manpower and material. Why attack now if we can attack in a year and take half the casualties?"
 ORD_intimidate_skaelinger:0 "Intimidate Skaelinger"
 ORD_intimidate_skaelinger_desc:0 "The rebels have made an alliance of desperation with the dwarves of Skaelinger. While we would love to wipe the bearded barbarians from the face of the planet, their warriors are battle-hardened, and it would not be in our interest to fight them now. We must pressure them to rescind their pact with the rebels."
 ORD_support_sympathisers:0 "Support Sympathisers"
 ORD_support_sympathisers_desc:0 "Though they aren't many, we still have our friends in the rebel-held lands. We should reach out to them and assist them in building counter-revolutionary resistance cells."
 ORD_direct_strike:0 "Direct Strike"
 ORD_direct_strike_desc:0 "There is a time for subterfuge and there is a time to sound the warhorns. That time is now. Our schemes have served their purpose - now we should leave things to the generals."
 ORD_slay_heresiarch:0 "Slay the Heresiarch"
 ORD_slay_heresiarch_desc:0 "The schismatic radicals of Rthaur are in awe of their leader, Derathur. If we could kill him in his sleep, we would demoralize the population and deal a crippling blow to the Rthaur government."
 ORD_crusade_for_quellion:0 "Crusade for Quellion"
 ORD_crusade_for_quellion_desc:0 "The prayers have been said and the omens are right. The schismatics in Rthauiaur are still reeling from the loss of their leader, and we shall cleanse our lands of their heresy!"
 ORD_fortify_the_border:0 "Fortify the Border"
 ORD_fortify_the_border_desc:0 "Over the years, we have suffered greatly from rebel raids across the poorly-guarded zone of conflict. As a result, we have lost ever more land. That ends here; we shall construct a line of forts to stop the rebels from enroaching further, and to act as staging posts for a counter-invasion."
 ORD_restore_order:0 "Restore Order"
 ORD_restore_order_desc:0 "It is time. Instruct the generals to attack at dawn."
 ORD_peace_with_skaelinger:0 "Peace with Skaelinger"
 ORD_peace_with_skaelinger_desc:0 "Though we would love to crush the cockroaches of Skaelinger underneath our boot, we have to prioritise restoring internal stability. Let's see if the dwarves are interested in a peace, for now."
 ORD_end_the_stronghold:0 "End the Stronghold"
 ORD_end_the_stronghold_desc:0 "Those of our men with Traditionalists beliefs could not be stopped from attacking the dwarves if we wanted to, and even the Moderates are concerned about leaving a well-defended hostile nation on our Eastern border. Let us push onward and end the Skaelinger threat once and for all."
 ORD_dominance:0 "Re-Establish Dominance"
 ORD_dominance_desc:0 "The Rosites have been crushed, their precious red banner in tatters. We are currently still treating this as a military occupation, when it in truth is nothing but the restoration of the legitimate government. Let us make sure our re-acquainted Eastern subjects know this as well."
 ORD_duchy_eastern_ordoria:0 "Establish the Duchy of Eastern Ordoria"
 ORD_duchy_eastern_ordoria_desc:0 "Even though their governmental institutions have been toppled, the Eastern rebellious spirit is too strong to break without unacceptable casaulty levels. Let us give them a limited amount of autonomy, so they won't try to break away from us again."
 ORD_united_once_more:0 "United Once More"
 ORD_united_once_more_desc:0 "Oh, joyous day! Finally, the elves of East and West stand united as brothers once again! For too long have we been divided and weak, but now - now we are strong together."
 ORD_direct_rule:0 "Direct Rule from Istaroth"
 ORD_direct_rule_desc:0 "Race traitors cannot be given any liberties, or they will go running to their dwarven friends again. We will end the military occupation, but we shall recruit town guards form local loyalists and the most dedicated of our Eastern citizens, to make sure the former rebels don't get any ideas."
 ORD_wars:0 "Oil the War Machine"
 ORD_wars_desc:0 "With our domestic situation secured, we can now look outwards, beyond our borders. Beyond our borders for now, at least..."
 ORD_military_academy:0 "Build the Vuid Officer's Academy"
 ORD_military_academy_desc:0 "We have plans to build a new military academy. Vuid, located very close to rebel-held territory, is a perfect location for such an institution; it allows for first-hand experience, and the presence of loyalist military forces might quell some of the pro-rebel sentiments..."
 ORD_elven_bows:0 "Elven Bows"
 ORD_elven_bows_desc:0 "Rumours have reached us that the inferior vermin of the North and South fear our archers, claiming that their bows are supernaturally accurate and powerful. While this is currently just a result of our keen Elven senses and experienced archers, developing such bows seems like an excellent idea."
 ORD_export_death:0 "Export Death"
 ORD_export_death_desc:0 "We have good soldiers and good weapons, but that matters little if we do not have good leaders. We must make sure the Vuid Academy emphasizes teaching aggressive doctrines to our future generals."
 ORD_mobile_warfare:0 "Adopt Mobility"
 ORD_mobile_warfare_desc:0 "We must strike furiously and never relent in the attack. It is of paramount importance that our forces are mobile, and ready to seize the initiative and exploit any advantages that show themselves, at any time."
 ORD_elven_horses:0 "Elf-Bred Horses"
 ORD_elven_horses_desc:0 "As our knights are perfectly pure beings of grace and power, so too must we only accept the finest of steeds. Let us institute a breeding program, so that we can give our mounted paragons the horses they deserve."
 ORD_stealth:0 "Elven Stealth"
 ORD_stealth_desc:0 "Elves are naturally stealthy and quiet, but we have not developed this into a military advantage. That has to change."
 ORD_grand_battleplan:0 "Adopt Resolve"
 ORD_grand_battleplan_desc:0 "We must steel our resolve and never waver, no matter the odds. We stand as a shining beacon of purity in a sea of vermin, and we must not falter in our cause."
 ORD_defense:0 "Purity is our Shield"
 ORD_defense_desc:0 "Our soldiers stand unwavering against the overwhelming tide of vermin. Not an inch of land shall be yielded to the enemy unless they buy it in oceans of blood."
 ORD_offense:0 "Hatred is our Sword"
 ORD_offense_desc:0 "Our warriors advance mercilessly, butchering any vermin in their path. We shall cleanse their filth off the face of the world."
 ORD_imperialism:0 "Imperial Ambitions"
 ORD_imperialism_desc:0 "The world yearns to be cleansed of vermin, and it longs to be cleansed now, not in thirty years'time. We must attack the lesser species without hesitation."
 ORD_provoke_realm:0 "Provoke the Realm"
 ORD_provoke_realm_desc:0 "Arthenon's little Realm has established itself quickly, with the aid of demonic magic, but it matters not. We will send some saboteurs into their land to divert attention from our main attack."
 ORD_seize_sothane:0 "Seize Sothane"
 ORD_seize_sothane_desc:0 "The tiny Duchy of Sothane, though of little economic value, is within spitting distance of the city of Cortineal, and is sparsely defended to boot. We'll send in some troops to take it as a staging post for our full invasion."
 ORD_invade_north:0 "Invade the North"
 ORD_invade_north_desc:0 "With Sothane in our hands and our army in position, it is finally time to cleanse the world of the stain that is the Realm."
 ORD_provoke_union:0 "Provoke the Union"
 ORD_provoke_union_desc:0 "Though the Ungerdaler Union has a staggering amount of soldiers, we know that one of us is worth ten of theirs. We shall goad them into losing their temper and make them bleed themselves dry in our jungles."
 ORD_punish_stahlhof:0 "Punish Stahlhof"
 ORD_punish_stahlhof_desc:0 "The pesky vermin of Stahlhof have been enroaching on our territory for years, now. This ends today. We will push them back out, step by step."
 ORD_invade_south:0 "Invade the South"
 ORD_invade_south_desc:0 "With our historical borders restored, it is time to end the Humans to our South once and for all. Sound the trumpets, for we ride to war."
 ORD_secure_beachhead:0 "Secure an Overseas Beachhead"
 ORD_secure_beachhead_long:0 "We are the undisputed masters of Latherin, and the rest of the nations on our side of the world will sooner or later fall to us. There are, however, still parts of the world out of our reach, firmly in the grasp of the vermin. This must be rectified immediately."
 ORD_long_game:0 "The Long Game"
 ORD_long_game_desc:0 "We are elves, our lifespan is measured in millenia. Time is on our side, so why rush things? Our domination of the world is inevitable, and we can afford to take all the time we need."
 ORD_destabilize_north:0 "Destabilize the North"
 ORD_destabilize_north_desc:0 "Though Arthenon's rule seems absolute, his regime is both foreign and young, and there are plenty of rebels still. It would do us well to support them, and hopefully fracture the Realm into weaker, squabbling, states."
 ORD_support_rebels:0 "Support the Kingsmen Rebels"
 ORD_support_rebels_desc:0 "It has come to our attention that a jumped-up, half-blooded mongrel peasant from Nastrogdar, Ulmién Astrellion, has amassed quite the army in a bid to seize the Blacksteel Throne. Apparently, the primitive gods of the local humans supposedly told him to 'free the Northern Plains from Arthenon's oppression'. Aiding him in staking this claim would surely weaken whoever comes out on top..."
 ORD_support_stoufellow:0 "Support Stoutfellow's Coup"
 ORD_support_stoufellow_desc:0 "Though Astrellion's revolt did indeed weaken the Realm, it seems we did too well - he's proven to be an extremely capable leader and has put the Men of the North on the path to a golden age. Fortunately, one of his confidants is an incompetent bellend with ambitions - it would do us well to put him on the throne instead."
 ORD_support_separatists:0 "Support the Separatists"
 ORD_support_separatists_desc:0 "We don't want to replace one Grand Master with another, we want to shatter the Realm entirely. Though putting an incompetent enough buffoon on the Blacksteel Throne could shatter the Realm without us lifting a finger, it would suit us better to simply support separatist causes."
 ORD_direct_intervention:0 "Direct Intervention"
 ORD_direct_intervention_desc:0 "Though we've managed to kick off at least some separatist revolts, Arthenon is still clinging to power. We need to ensure a total victory for the separatists."
 ORD_sweep_remains:0 "Sweep up the Remains"
 ORD_sweep_remains_desc:0 "We have successfully brought ruin to the Grand Master's Realm, that once proud empire now reduced to pathetically weak city-states. It is time to wander in and claim what is ours."
 ORD_destabilize_south:0 "Destabilize the South"
 ORD_destabilize_south_desc:0 "The Freiprinzen are already continually at each other's throat, and destabilizing the Union further would take very little. A few choice assassinations would aid our cause greatly."
 ORD_stahlhof_gambit:0 "The Stahlhof Gambit"
 ORD_stahlhof_gambit_desc:0 "Stahlhof's leader is an ambitious man, and rumour has it the army's he's supposedly gathering to fight us is in fact meant to take the Freithron from the current Hochprinzessin. If we promise Schwarzenbach the throne of the Union, he might just be persuaded to switch sides..."
 ORD_divide_princes:0 "Divide the Princes"
 ORD_divide_princes_desc:0 "We've riled up the Ungerdaler nobility quite a bit, but the Union is still hanging on by a thread. Let us sever it."
 ORD_shatter_union:0 "Shatter the Union"
 ORD_shatter_union_desc:0 "Important Ungerdaler nobles are dropping like flies, and there's open fighting in the streets. All the Union needs to be sent into the grave is one final push, and we will be happy to deliver it."
 ORD_hegemony:0 "Ordorian Hegemony"
 ORD_hegemony_desc:0 "Our domination over Latherin is final, with the only two serious threats to our hegemony utterly crushed. The banner of the Flaming Tree now flutters proudly from Navandonne to Schneefilde!"
 ORD_compensate_industry:0 "Compensate for our Lost Industry"
 ORD_compensate_industry_desc:0 "When the rebels declared their independence, they took with them a significant part of our industry. We need to encourage the industrialization of our smaller towns to make up for the deficit."
 ORD_foreign_labour:0 "Exploit Foreign Labour"
 ORD_foreign_labour_desc:0 "Though we shall allow some demi-Elves to stay in our great nation, they will have to prove their worth to us. If they want to live here, they need to earn it."
 ORD_right_tool:0 "The Right Tool for the Job"
 ORD_right_tool_desc:0 "You wouldn't use a pickaxe to cut down a tree, so why should we use a Human to mine ore when a perfectly good Dwarf is able and willing to do the job? By exploiting the strengths of each race, we can significantly increase the efficiency of our economy."
 ORD_limited_trade:0 "Limited Trade"
 ORD_limited_trade_desc:0 "Though we historically have relied on our own resources as much as possible, this is simply no longer feasible. We must utilize our demi-Elven communities to establish limited trade ties with the outside world."
 ORD_enslave_vermin:0 "Enslave the Vermin"
 ORD_enslave_vermin_desc:0 "Though we long for the day where the world is purified of the vermin, for now, we can make use of them. We do not want our pure-blood kin wasting away in dank mines and in the fields, but the vermin are perfect for the task, and there's plenty more where they came from. If they work themselves to death providing us with resources, they'll be of at least some use for their superiors."
 ORD_free_purebloods:0 "Free the Purebloods"
 ORD_free_purebloods_desc:0 "Now that we have got the vermin into the mines, it's time to get our pure-blooded kin out. Members of our race should not have to endure such circumstances if there's lesser species to do it for them. This will also free up skilled workers for our industrialization programs."
 ORD_industrialization_programs:0 "Industrialization Programs"
 ORD_industrialization_programs_desc:0 "Now that we have expanded our pools of slaves and skilled workers, it's time to put both to use. Double the mining quotas! Draw up the plans! We shall usher in an age of steam and progress for all Elves to enjoy!"
 ORD_recovered_industry:0 "Recovered Industry"
 ORD_recovered_industry_desc:0 "We have made up for our industrial deficit caused by the rebels in the East, and our citizenry can once again enjoy a pre-rebellion standard of living! Let all Elves enjoy our shared prosperity!"
 ORD_elven_labour:0 "Elven Labour"
 ORD_elven_labour_desc:0 "We must not let our soil, our resources, our very nation, be tainted by the touch of the lesser species. We must rely on Elven brain and Elven brawn alone, and with those ingredients we shall build a paradise." 
 ORD_elven_wits:0 "Elven Wits"
 ORD_elven_wits_desc:0 "Now that we have the industrial base we need to fuel our war machine, it is time to put our brightest minds to the pursuit of ever deadlier weapons for our soldiers and make up with machines what we lack in elfpower."
 ORD_elven_might:0 "Elven Might"
 ORD_elven_might_desc:0 "The omens were right! With Elven toil and Elven brains have we built a war machine the envy of the world - soon, it shall conquer the world for Elves to enjoy."
 ORD_militarized_economy:0 "Militarized Economy"
 ORD_militarized_economy_desc:0 "Though some complain about our lack of civilian industry, they are fools. We have taken the opportunity granted to us by the lowered standard of living to encourage an austere lifestyle, saving resources for the army. We shall have plenty when our armies have taken over the world, and what's a decade of hardship to an Elf?"
 ORD_university_varinthia:0 "Found the University of Varinthia"
 ORD_university_varinthia_desc:0 "Now that our economic situation has been sorted out, it is time to expand our seats of learning. Varinthia's central location makes it a prime candidate for a new university."
 ORD_future_of_foreigners:0 "Future of the Foreigners"
 ORD_future_of_foreigners_desc:0 "One of the top points of contention during the Autumn Debate was the future of the non-Elves in our country. Unsurprisingly, their community leaders have quite vocally supported the Moderate position, but their fate still balances on a knife's edge."
 ORD_second_class_citizenry:0 "Second-Class Citizenship"
 ORD_second_class_citizenry_desc:0 "Though Ordoria must of course remain a nation for Elves first and foremost, some demi-Elves have proven their worth and should be allowed residence. While this might cause them to bring their own political ideas into our nation, it is sure to garner support for the government from these people as well."
 ORD_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
 ORD_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "It appears communities have formed amongst the demi-Elves. Though our Traditionalist and Faithful rivals cry out for these to be destroyed, we believe they can be of use to us - if handled properly."
 ORD_promote_hofmeyer:0 "Promote Hofmeyer"
 ORD_promote_hofmeyer_desc:0 "The Human Hofmeyer has shown to be extremely good at his work, even by Elven standards, and his loyalty to Ordoria is beyond question. Even though he is not an Elf, he should be appointed Governor of Ythelmare."
 ORD_fuck_hofmeyer:0 "Put Hofmeyer Back in His Place"
 ORD_fuck_hofmeyer_desc:0 "Hofmeyer has advanced as far as any non-Elf is able to and then some, and yet he has the audacity to ask for more. He must be made an example of. The non-Elves must remember their place."
 ORD_segregated_society:0 "Segregated Society"
 ORD_segregated_society_desc:0 "Though we allow demi-Elves to live and work in our nation, they are second-class citizens. Ordoria is a country for Elves first!"
 ORD_deverminize_cities:0 "De-Verminization of the Cities"
 ORD_deverminize_cities_desc:0 "Though the Traditionalists have held power for a few brief years, there are still vermin living in our cities, eating our food, taking our jobs. It is time to fix this."
 ORD_puritan_propaganda:0 "Puritan Propaganda"
 ORD_puritan_propaganda_desc:0 "Though we have seen to it that our cities are no longer polluted by the vermin, some of our own still doubt our policy. We msut see to it that this is rectified."
 ORD_trial_acquit:0 "Acquit the Five"
 ORD_trial_acquit_desc:0 "The royal family can breathe easy - King Galerin Valinthir's efforts to save his son have paid off, and the Five have been acquitted of treason!"
 ORD_trial_guilty:0 "Declare the Five Guilty"
 ORD_trial_guilty_desc:0 "The King's efforts have been for naught - Laurennis Valinthir and his co-conspirators have been found guilty of treason, and they shall soon be executed!"
 ORD_pure_society:0 "Pure Society"
 ORD_pure_society_desc:0 "Though we have some of the vermin as beasts of burden in our mines and fields, doing the heavy labour on which Elven perfection would be wasted, all respectable parts of society have been scrubbed clean of their filth."
 ORD_create_inquisition:0 "Create the Inquisition"
 ORD_create_inquisition_desc:0 "It is our holy mission, bestowed upon us by the Seven, to cleanse the world of the vermin, no matter where they hide. Let us create a paramilitary wing of the Church tasked with hunting down every last piece of sub-Elven filth."
 ORD_hunt_heretics:0 "Hunt Heretics"
 ORD_hunt_heretics_desc:0 "Though the divine righteousness of our cause is clear, there are those among us that would betray our holy principles and stand by the vermin. They, too, must be removed from this planet as the affronts to the Gods that they are."
 ORD_conclave_tolerate:0 "Tolerate the Moderates"
 ORD_conclave_tolerate_desc:0 "They may be deluded and foolish Elves, but the Moderates are Elves nonetheless. They surely have a place in the great designs of the Seven, and it is not for us to meddle with them."
 ORD_conclave_heretical:0 "Declare the Moderates Heretical"
 ORD_conclave_heretical_desc:0 "The Moderate faction spits on the sacrosanct Elven ideal and disrespect the core tenets of our holy Church. Kill them all and let the Seven sort them out."
 ORD_holy_society:0 "Holy Society"
 ORD_holy_society_desc:0 "Our nation has been purified of sin by the eradication of the vermin that soiled it, and we are a beacon of righteous light in this world of filth and darkness."
 ORD_expand_shipyards:0 "Expand the Ythelmare Shipyards"
 ORD_expand_shipyards_desc:0 "Though for now we are mostly concerned with land-based warfare, we must not neglect our navy. Our shipyards in Ythelmare must be bought up to modern standards at once."
 ORD_more_navy:0 "Further Naval Development"
 ORD_more_navy_desc:0 "Our naval capacity has been improved, but not to the extent that we need. Direct more resources to the development of our naval industry."
 ORD_more_port:0 "Expand the Port Network"
 ORD_more_port_desc:0 "Though our navy is now up to snuff, the infrastructure to support it is not. We must construct more ports and develop the ones we already have."
 ORD_safe_port:0 "Safe Havens"
 ORD_safe_port_desc:0 "We have enough ports, but they are difficult to defend in the case of an enemy invasion. Our navy needs its bases, and we must make sure they shall be able to keep them."
 ORD_sponsor_privateers:0 "Sponsor Privateers"
 ORD_sponsor_privateers_desc:0 "We do not have enough resources to build a navy to rival that of the Union or the Realm without fatally weakening our army, but we have plenty of young nobles and rogue captains willing to do our work for us. All they need is our word."
 ORD_coast_raids:0 "Authorize Coastal Raids"
 ORD_coast_raids_desc:0 "Though our privateers have been content with the spoils of ships, those treasures are nothing compared to the wealth found in port cities. We must authorise coastal raids to exploit these riches."
 ORD_raid_port:0 "No Safe Havens"
 ORD_raid_port_desc:0 "Nowhere must our enemies find safety. We shall sail to their ports, shatter their defenses and slaughter them all, no matter their preparations."
 ORD_big_fleet:0 "Fleet in Being"

 ORD_raiding_fleet:0 "Raiding Fleet"
 ORD_raiding_fleet_desc:0 "We are creatures of elegance and grace, and this must be reflected in our naval doctrine. Let other nations traverse the oceans in brutish constructs, we shall set sail in only the sleekest of ships."
 ORD_sink_ships:0 "Harass the Merchant Ships"
 ORD_sink_ships_desc:0 "Much trade goes on between the Union and the Realm, primarily overseas. Though we do not have the numbers to end this completely, our navy is very well suited to raiding and sinking individual convoys."
 HLZ_mad_prince:0 "The Mad Prince"
 HLZ_mad_prince_desc:0 "Our country suffers under the tyrannical yoke of the Mad Prince, Freiprinz Kaspar Rosenblut. His actions have caused great suffering, and it is unlikely the people of Holzbrenn will put up with it for much longer..."
 HLZ_carpenter_strike:0 "The Carpenter's Strike"
 HLZ_carpenter_strike_desc:0 "The unrest in the Princedom has reached a boiling point - the people of the capital's Woodworking District have taken to the streets in protest! As our country's economy primarily relies on the export of wooden furniture, this is a disaster!"
 HLZ_last_straw:0 "The Last Straw"
 HLZ_last_straw_desc:0 "If Rosenblut's brutal suppression of the Carpenter's Strike wouldn't have caused the entire country to revolt, his unjust mass executions of those involved certainly did the trick. Across the country, from the poorest hovel to the most opulent mansion, cries of defiance are ringing proudly in the night - Down with the Freiprinz! End the Reign!"
 HLZ_nobility_steps_in:0 "The Nobility Steps In"
 HLZ_nobility_steps_in_desc:0 "Appalled by Rosenblut's actions, the nobles of the country have levied their troops and marched on the capital. Holzbrenn and his cronies have fled the Princedom, and envoys have already been sent to Hochprinzessin to explain the situation. The Mad Prince's reign has come to an end!"
 HLZ_never_another_tyrant:0 "Never Another Tyrant"
 HLZ_never_another_tyrant_desc:0 "The nobility of Holzbrenn has resolved to never again allow a Hochprinz to wield the power Rosenblut had, to prevent a second Mad Prince. To satisfy the requirements of the Union, the Council of Dukes shall crown one of their own as nominal Hochprinz, but all power shall rest in the hands of the Council of Dukes."
 HLZ_among_masses:0 "Among the Masses"
 HLZ_among_masses_desc:0 "Despite it being the aristocracy who liberated the country from the reign of Rosenblut, many of the lower classes still distrust the aristocracy, seeing them as complicit in the Mad Prince's excesses. The Council has conceded that this might be a reasonable concern, and has ordered all loyal nobles to spend time amongst their subjects in order to gain their trust and improve the nobility's reputation."
 HLZ_gutprinz_prinzip:0 "The Gutprinz-Prinzip"
 HLZ_gutprinz_prinzip_desc:0 "Though the nobility has recognized the need for a Freiprinz, they are hesitant to give him as free a hand as Rosenblut had. To this end, we have instituted the Goodprince-Principle: if the nobility, or even the common folk, deem a Prince to be unfit to rule, it is their right - nay, their duty - to overthrow them."
 HLZ_limit_princely_power:0 "Limit Princely Power"
 HLZ_limit_princely_power_desc:0 "Having been elected Freiprinz, Konrad Beckenbauer has drafted a bill that would severely limit his own power and submitted it to the Council of Dukes for review. Passing this act would place great safeguards on our fledgeling system."

 HLZ_aristocrats_in_soup_kitchens_desc:0 "Some of the younger members of the nobility have taken to setting up and even working in soup kitchens for the poor, in an effort to reach out to the common folk. The Council should encourage similar initiatives across the country."
 HLZ_assuage_worries:0 "Assuage Worries"
 HLZ_assuage_worries_desc:0 "Despite our newly implemented safeguards against tyranny, many of the common folk and even some nobles express concern about still having a Prince. Freiprinz Konrad has decided to speak to the people in person and convince them that there is nothing to worry about."
 HLZ_feed_people:0 "Ration Foodstuffs"
 HLZ_feed_people_desc:0 "Rosenblut has been intentionally starving the people while throwing lavish banquets for his followers, and we must address this situation at once. Massive relief projects have been started to remedy immediate starvation, and long-term plans to increase food production to a satisfactory level are in the making, but we must deal with the acute problems of famine by rationing what we have."
 HLZ_repurpose_mansions:0 "Repurpose Mansions"
 HLZ_repurpose_mansions_desc:0 "It seems our efforts to let aristocracy and peasantry mix has produced an unexpected side-effect: seeing the plight of the common folk, many nobles have gone to great lengths to improve the lives of their subjects. Some have even converted their mansions into homes for multiple families, hospitals, or schools. The Council must support such endeavours."
 HLZ_repurpose_altpalast:0 "Repurpose the Altpalast"
 HLZ_repurpose_altpalast_desc:0 "Though traditionally, the Freiprinzen have lived in the Old Palace, it still bears the taint of Rosenblut's tyranny. Let us turn this house of grief into a house of hope - an orphanage? A poorhouse? A school? Why not all three? It's big enough."
 HLZ_renovierungsprogramm:0 "The Renovierungsprogramm"
 HLZ_renovierungsprogramm_desc:0 "Though the efforts by some of our aristocrats to turn their mansions into houses for the public are commendable, we cannot rely on such measures alone. We must initiate a bold plan to renovate the slums of Holzbrenn and expand our rural towns."
 HLZ_rehabilitate_altpalast:0 "Rehabilitate the Altpalast"
 HLZ_rehabilitate_altpalast_desc:0 "Though the Altpalast is tainted by association with Rosenblut, it is the only building that could house our new Council of Aristocrats. We must scrub it clean of every reminder of the Mad Freiprinz, and turn it into a symbol of justice and righteous governance."
 HLZ_adelshauser:0 "Adelshäuser"
 HLZ_adelshauser_desc:0 "We have done much, but there are still many of our subjects living in inadequate housing. To tackle this, the Edlerrate has authorized the counstruction of 'Adelshäuser', or Noble's Houses - well-built houses sponsored by the local nobility."
 HLZ_open_universities:0 "Open the University"
 HLZ_open_universities_desc:0 "Under the yoke of Rosenblut, the University of Holzbrenn was little more than a propaganda house, open only to the nobility. It is time we restore its status as house of learning, and allow anyone so inclined to study there."
 HLZ_patronage_brightest:0 "Patronage for the Brightest"
 HLZ_patronage_brightest_desc:0 "The University require our backing, but it cannot handle half of Holzbrenn flooding in at once. By scouring the land and selecting the best and brightest - no matter their social position - for enrolment, we can be sure that the University can handle the influx of new students, while giving opportunities for advancement to everyone in the Freiprinztum."
 HLZ_judicial_institutions:0 "Re-Establish Judicial Institutions"

 HLZ_institutionalize_petitions:0 "Institutionalize Petitions"
 HLZ_institutionalize_petitions_desc:0 "The practice of petitions, where common folk visit the local aristocrat's court to seek a settlement of disputes or compensation for grievances, has allowed the peasantry to voice protests without resorting to torches and pitchforks. We should formalize and strengthen this practice."
 HLZ_rule_nobility:0 "The Rule of Nobility"
 HLZ_rule_nobility_desc:0 "With the restoration of ancient legal traditions, order has returned to our society. Our people trust in their local nobility to pass judgement with the wisdom of their social class, and all feel safe once more."
 HLZ_freiprinzliche_richter:0 "Freiprinzliche Richter"
 HLZ_freiprinzliche_richter_desc:0 "The system of local nobility functioning as judge is far too reliant on individuals being competent and just. We must instead build an independent legal system, with judgement passed based on law, rather than an aristocrat's opinion."
 HLZ_establish_rechtsakademie:0 "Establish the Rechtsakademie"

 HLZ_rule_law:0 "The Rule of Law"
 HLZ_rule_law_desc:0 "Our courts have been depoliticized, and the judge has taken the place of the noble in passing judgement on criminals and legal disputes. Our people trust the system to fairly uphold the law, and no one is above it."
 HLZ_relegitimization:0 "Relegitimize Blue Blood"
 HLZ_relegitimization_desc:0 "The nobility is tainted by association with Rosenblut, and popular support for the noble houses remains low. We must reverse these unfortunate developments and restore trust in the feudal system, before the Republicans or the Rosites come knocking."
 HLZ_relegitimization_institutions:0 "Relegitimization through Institutions"
 HLZ_relegitimization_institutions_desc:0 "Most of our institutions, the Church in particular, are very supportive of the feudal system, as they derive a significant part of their power from it. We should use this to our advantage."
 HLZ_appeal_church:0 "Appeal to the Church"
 HLZ_appeal_church_desc:0 "Many of our people hold the Church in the highest regard. By requesting the canonization of the ancestors of prominent noble families, encouraging pro-state messages in sermons and other such actions, we can use piety to shore up support for the state."
 HLZ_concessions_clergy:0 "Concessions to the Clergy"
 HLZ_concessions_clergy_desc:0 "The priests have been crucial in making feudalism salonfähig once again in Holzbrenn. We should seek to repay the favour."
 HLZ_relegitimization_dialogue:0 "Relegitimization through Dialogue"
 HLZ_relegitimization_dialogue_desc:0 "Our people's worries come not from blind hatred towards the nobility, but from legitimate concerns of another Kaspar Rosenblut rising to the throne. By talking to the common populace, we can dispel these fears and restore trust in the system."
 HLZ_acknowledge_complicity:0 "Acknowledge Complicity"
 HLZ_acknowledge_complicity_desc:0 "Rosenblut came from our own ranks, and we did not act to oust him as early as we could have. There is blood on our hands, and by issuing an official acknowledgement of guilt and an apology, we could make large strides towards mending the rift in our society."
 HLZ_concessions_peasantry:0 "Concessions to the Peasantry"
 HLZ_concessions_peasantry_desc:0 "The farmers, serfs and other peasants suffered by far the most from Rosenblut's excesses. They deserve reparations for what the Mad Freiprinz did to them."

 HLZ_aristocracy_accepted:0 "Aristocracy Accepted"
 HLZ_aristocracy_accepted_desc:0 "It has taken much work, and some people will simply never be on our side, but we finally enjoy support from the common people once again. The Seven save the Freiprinz!"
 HLZ_repairing_image:0 "Repairing our Image"
 HLZ_repairing_image_desc:0 "The reign of the Mad Freiprinz has not been good for our standing in the Union; what few diplomats paid homage to other Freiprinzen were usually inept cronies, and Rosenblut himself has racked up quite the list of diplomatic insults, and that's ignoring his heretical dabblings in sorcery. We must begin to regain our diplomatic footing at once."
 HLZ_socialite_prince:0 "The Socialite Prince"
 HLZ_socialite_prince_desc:0 "Freiprinz Beckenbauer is already rather charismatic, and his reputation as a socialite is well-known throughout the land. Several invitations to balls, receptions and other social events have already been extended, and this would be an excellent opportunity to increase our standing in the eyes of the Union's upper crust."
 HLZ_exploit_dynastic_ties:0 "Exploit Dynastic Ties"
 HLZ_exploit_dynastic_ties_desc:0 "Many of the nobles in our government have extended family ties in foreign courts. By reaching out to these family members, we can gain a foothold in estranged courts and begin to reverse the damage Rosenblut did to our reputation."
 HLZ_found_beziehungsburo:0 "Found the Beziehungsburö"
 HLZ_found_beziehungsburo_desc:0 "The old system of relying on throwing whatever noble we happen to have lying around at foreign courts and hope good relations come out of it no longer works. We need to set up a formal Bureau of Relations to manage our diplomatic efforts."
 HLZ_edlerrat:0 "The Edlerrat"
 HLZ_edlerrat_desc:0 "The Council of Dukes has now solidified its control of the Freiprinztum, but there are still problems that need to be dealt with. Primarily, we need to tackle the anti-Elven sentiments among our Human population, and we need to shore up popular support."
 HLZ_equality_act:0 "Pass the Equality Act"
 HLZ_equality_act_desc:0 "Despite having ousted Rosenblut's regime, his mark still lingers on much of our legislation, barring non-Humans from owning land, prohibiting them from occupying high positions, and other Puritan nonsense. It is time we lift these restrictions on our people, so all can stand equal under the Crown."
 HLZ_talk_libertines:0 "Talk with the Libertines"
 HLZ_talk_libertines_desc:0 "Several voices on the Council have raised in favour of reaching out to the Libertines, and perhaps even allowing them a seat or two at the Council, despite not being nobility. After all, they represent a large portion of our people, and deserve to be heard."
 HLZ_constitution_noble:0 "The Noble Constitution"

 HLZ_talk_league:0 "Talk with the League"
 HLZ_talk_league_desc:0 "Despite being opposed to the nobility in general and the Freiprinz in particular, the leader of the Solidarity League have let us know they would be interested in negotiations.

 HLZ_introduce_welfare:0 "Introduce Welfare"
 HLZ_introduce_welfare_desc:0 "The Rosite delegation at the Council proposed an expansion of our various social programs into a social safety net of sorts, that would guarantee that no one would go hungry or homeless. Many nobles regard this idea positively, even though it would be a great financial burden on them." 
 HLZ_elven_representation:0 "Elven Representation"
 HLZ_elven_representation_desc:0 "Thanks to Rosenblut's vile rhetoric, Elf-Human relations in Holzbrenn are at an all-time low. We must grant the Elven community a representative on the Edlerrat in order to rebuild unity in our society."
 HLZ_enlightened_nobility:0 "Enlightened Nobility"
 HLZ_enlightened_nobility_desc:0 "In our Principality, the nobility and the commoners stand side by side, both working together to secure a brighter future for each other. Old prejudices have fallen away, and a new age of unity has dawned. Our noble-commoner relations are the envy of the Union!"

 HLZ_idyllischen_prinztum_desc:0 "In our country, there is no oppression of the peasants by the nobles, but co-operation. There is no fear of the aristocrats in the hearts of the lower classes, but respect as equals. Ours is an idyllic Princedom, now and forever more!"

 HLZ_request_excommunication:0 "Request Excommunication"
 HLZ_request_excommunication_desc:0 "The Church of the Seven is one of the most influential institutions in the Union, and more importantly, their power isn't limited by borders of the Freiprinztümer. If we get Pressler excommunicated, it will severely limit his ability to organize a counter-revolution."
 HLZ_push_banishment:0 "Push for Banishment"
 HLZ_push_banishment_desc:0 "Pressler is trying to organize his army of rabble-rousers and build up a reputation as legitimate claimant to the throne. If he were to be banished, it would undermine both his image and his ability to organize an army."
 HLZ_no_rest_wicked:0 "No Rest for the Wicked"
 HLZ_no_rest_wicked_desc:0 "No matter what court Pressler runs to, no matter what he tries to do, we shall hinder his every step. We shall see to it that every door is slammed in his face, that every noble will turn him away, that every mercenary he approaches spits on his offers. He shall have no allies in this world."
 HLZ_hard_power:0 "Hard Power"
 HLZ_hard_power_desc:0 "A deceased conspirator cannot seize power. We will hunt down Pressler's clique and put them to the sword."
 HLZ_bounty:0 "Put a Price on Pressler's Head"
 HLZ_bounty_desc:0 "Coin is an excellent motivator, and many adventurers and mercenaries are happy to take up bounty hunting if the pay is right. Let it be known we will reward anyone who brings us Pressler's head handsomely."
 HLZ_military_hunt:0 "Punitive Expedition"
 HLZ_military_hunt_desc:0 "Pressler poses an existential threat to the Freiprinztum of Holzbrenn, and thus we are well within our rights to launch a punitive expedition against anyone who hosts him. Assemble a company to send after him."

 HLZ_assembly_libertine:0 "The Libertine Assembly"
 HLZ_bauernherren:0 "The Bauernherren"
 HLZ_bauernherren_desc:0 "The Bauernherren, or 'Gentlemen Farmers', have rapidly become a force to be reckoned with, buying up land that has been unused since Rosenblut's policies and the famine drove many of our people away. We will have to consider their impact on our society and respond accordingly."
 HLZ_support_bauernherren:0 "Support the Bauernherren"
 HLZ_support_bauernherren_desc:0 "The Bauernherren are the victors in the competition of our economy, and therefore are the best and brightest Holzbrenn has to offer. We should support them, so that they may bring ever greater riches to our Freiprinztum."
 HLZ_efficiency_scale:0 "Efficiency through Scale"
 HLZ_efficiency_scale_desc:0 "The size of the Bauernherren's estates allows them to make more productive use of plows and other means of production, as well as assign people to specific tasks, rather than a few people constantly having to switch between the type of work they do. This has led to increased efficiency on the farm."
 HLZ_machen_lassen:0 "Machen-Lassen"
 HLZ_machen_lassen_desc:0 "We have seen the rise of wealthy Bauernherren in some areas, and Smallholders enduring in others. We should let economics take their natural course, and not interfere in the developments the market brings."

 HLZ_support_smallholders:0 "Support the Smallholders"
 HLZ_support_smallholders_desc:0 "Huge conglomerates of wealthy estates are not in the interests of our people. We should encourage the proliferation of smaller farmsteads instead, to make sure our people can support themselves, and not have to rely on a wealthy Bauernherr for their livelihoods."
 HLZ_efficiency_interests:0 "Efficiency through Personal Interests"
 HLZ_efficiency_interests_desc:0 "A farmer with a personal interest in crops he grows and the livestock he raises will take far better care of them than one who is paid by the day to look after them. By making sure our people have a personal investment in their farmsteads, we will see productivity rise."
 HLZ_big_breaks:0 "Tax Breaks for the Big"
 HLZ_big_breaks_desc:0 "The estates of the Bauernherren have proven to be economic powerhouses. We should reduce the burden of taxation on them, so that they can re-invest even more into their farm, and bring even more prosperity to the people of Holzbrenn!"
 HLZ_small_subsidies:0 "Subsidies for the Small"
 HLZ_small_subsidies_desc:0 "The farms of the Smallholders may not make any individual particularly rich, but they mean our people are all secure in a livelihood. We should provide support to those Smallholders that are currently struggling, to prevent them from going under."

 HLZ_create_beratungsrat_desc:0 "While we of course support our merchants in their commercial endeavours, we admit the League has a point when they cite the injustices inflicted on the workers by their employer.

Co-operation will surely bring prosperity to all."
 HLZ_constitution_libertine:0 "The Libertine Constitution"
 HLZ_constitution_libertine_desc:0 "Though we have already written a great many freedoms into law, this is done in seperate documents, all referencing each other. The end result is a mess of paperwork and a legislative nightmare.

 HLZ_co_government:0 "Co-Government"
 HLZ_co_government_desc:0 "Though two factions have emerged as the biggest following the elections - the Libertines and the Solidarity League - neither can govern alone. As such, a compromise must be worked out between the two, so that we can form a co-government."
 HLZ_feed_poor:0 "Feed the Poor"
 HLZ_feed_poor_desc:0 "While the Libertines and the League are divided on the issue of land redistribution, both agree that the famine currently sweeping the country has to be dealt with immediately.

 HLZ_state_sponsored_hospitals:0 "State-Sponsored Hospitals"

 HLZ_freigilde:0 "Establish Freigilde"
 HLZ_freigilde_desc:0 "Though the existing Guilds were one of the motors of the revolution, allowing for co-ordination and planning of the uprising on a national level, they are very stratified institutions, denying the poor social mobility.

 HLZ_equal_rights_desc:0 "Though Rosenblut and his cronies have long since been kicked out of the country, they have left a stain of discrimination on our legal framework and our culture.

 HLZ_anti_discrimination_campaigns:0 "Anti-Discrimination Campaigns"

 HLZ_it_can_work_desc:0 "Though cynics on all sides claimed that our co-government would fall to infighting and petty squabbles, their doomsaying has proven wrong.

 HLZ_never_another_starving_man_desc:0 "Though we are already forming an emergency plan with the Libertines to deal with the immediate famine in the country, we must pass some bills supporting land redistribution so that in the future, large swathes of land shall not go uncultivated by nobles who have more acres than they know what to do with, while unemployed peasants go hungry.

During Rosenblut's reign, many of our people died or left the country, resulting in a few people ending up with most of the land, leaving them rich at the expense of many others. This injustice cannot stand."
 HLZ_republican_farms:0 "Republikanische Bauernhöfe"
 HLZ_republican_farms_desc:0 "The government is run by the people, and the people must run the farms. Ergo, the farms must be operated by the government. This will ensure that the produce and profits go to benefit the people, rather than line the pockets of the rich."
 HLZ_state_deputies:0 "Abgeordnete des Staates"
 HLZ_state_deputies_desc:0 "Though we can broadly steer the running of large farms from the capital, messengers take time to bring news to us and bring orders back to the farms. In order to react more quickly to local crises as well as provide closer oversight, we will have the farmers elect local Deputies of State to act as the local governmental representative. Subject to approval by the government, of course."
 HLZ_encourage_communalization:0 "Encourage Communalization"
 HLZ_encourage_communalization_desc:0 "Those that work the land know best what the land needs. Rather than enforce a solution from above, we should promote communal farming by local farmers instead."
 HLZ_communal_tax:0 "Communal Tax"
 HLZ_communal_tax_desc:0 "More and more of our farmers have pooled their resources, but our tax system is still built around the individual. We will have to reform taxation and introduce a tax on communal farms."
 HLZ_mandate_smallholds:0 "Mandate Smallholds"
 HLZ_mandate_smallholds_desc:0 "Why should anyone own more land than they know what to do with? By mandating that any farm be a Smallhold, ran by an individual or a family at most, we can make sure no-one takes more than their fair share. What they grow shall be theirs, and not a kernel of grain more."
 HLZ_day_plow_rule:0 "The Day-Plow Rule"
 HLZ_day_plow_rule_desc:0 "The definition of what constitutes a 'Smallhold' is very loose, almost to the point of subjectivity. While this was good enough for a long time, our new laws require a stricter definition of the term. We shall make it so that nobody may own more land than they can plow in a single day."
 HLZ_compensate_affected:0 "Compensate the Affected"
 HLZ_compensate_affected_desc:0 "While we care not for the complaints of the wealthy that have seen their lands redistributed, we have also adversely affected some poorer farmer. It seems only fair to compensate them for the temporary damage to their livelihoods."
 HLZ_utopia_compensation:0 "Utopia as Compensation"
 HLZ_utopia_compensation_desc:0 "Though we understand the discontent of our people with some of our redistributory measures, we cannot compromise on justice. We are working towards building a paradise here in Holzbrenn, and that shall be compensation enough."
 HLZ_finish_land_reform:0 "Finish Land Reform"
 HLZ_finish_land_reform_desc:0 "We have managed to complete our ambitious program of land reform, and the successes are already evident - our people are reporting ever greater harvests, and the livestock is fatter than ever!"
 HLZ_idyllischen_republik:0 "Idyllischen Republik"
 HLZ_idyllischen_republik_desc:0 "Our republic is the envy of the Union, with debates, negotiations and reasoning taking precedence over displays of power and violence in all levels of society. The spirit of freedom burns strong in every Holzbrenners' heart - never again shall a tyrant impose their will on our Republic!"
 HLZ_end_madness:0 "End the Madness"
 HLZ_end_madness_desc:0 "Even though our government has long since expelled the tyrannical House Rosenblut and his influence on our laws, his toxic ideas had already seeped into our people by the time the Mad Prince was ousted. It has thus far proven difficult to purge such twisted sentiments from our culture, but with one last push, we are confident we can cleanse our country of Rosenblut's twisted ideals!"
 HLZ_princely_army_recovery:0 "Regain our Lost Military Glory"
 HLZ_princely_army_recovery_desc:0 "During the heydays of the Freiprinztum under Edmund the Good, Holzbrenn's army was respected by our allies and feared by our enemies. Drilled to perfection and equipped with the finest arms and armour our blacksmiths could provide, its memory now naught but a memory, tarnished by Kaspar's corruption of our once proud forces. We will have to intitiate extensive programs to rebuild our might."
 HLZ_military_investment:0 "Light up the Forges Once More"
 HLZ_military_investment_desc:0 "Let the flames of our forge burn bright! When our country suffered under the yoke of the Mad Freiprinz, many of our smiths departed to greener pastures, and most of our forges were shut down, crippling our military industry. Through a momentous effort, we can rebuild our decrepit forges and arm our troops once more."
 HLZ_prospect_for_resources:0 "Prospect for Iron"
 HLZ_prospect_for_resources_desc:0 "The forests of Holzbrenn provide us with plenty of fuel for the forges, but importing iron in the amounts we need for our rearmament programmes is prohibitively expensive. We will have to open up mines of our own."
 HLZ_artillery_resources:0 "Fine-Tune the Kanonenlegierung"
 HLZ_artillery_resources_desc:0 "Though simple steel will do for swords, halberds and even arquebuses, the newly-developed cannons require special alloys, forged with very unforgiving coal-to-steel ratios. Through trial by error, we will have to find the perfect alloy for our cannons."
 HLZ_artillery_improvements:0 "The Holzbrenner Cannon Foundries"
 HLZ_artillery_improvements_desc:0 "With the techniques of forging the Cannon's Alloy firmly in our grasp, it is time to being mass-production of these fearsome siege weapons. Let us open a Cannon Foundry in the city, to provide our army with all the heavy firepower it needs."
 HLZ_industrial_development:0 "Request Support from the Hochprinztum"
 HLZ_industrial_development_desc:0 "While we are sure to eventually get back on our feet in due time, Ordoria's bellicose stance means we need to be ready now, not in ten years' time. We must send an envoy to the Hochprinzessin and ask her for financial support in rebuilding our military industry."
 HLZ_armed_forces_equipment_upgrade:0 "Study Stahlhof"
 HLZ_armed_forces_equipment_upgrade_desc:0 "With our basic needs in terms of armaments covered, it is time to consider making improvements to our current gear. Freiprinz Schwarzenbach has been very busy ensuring his soldiers have thee latest in military technology; we should ask him to share his secrets. We are both on the front line against Ordorian aggression, after all."
 HLZ_strategic_battleplans:0 "Kriegsplan Nord"
 HLZ_strategic_battleplans_desc:0 "With our army whipped back into shape and kitted out with proper gear once more, it is time to begin drawing up battle-plans for dealing with Ordoria. Our generals are recommending a bold strategy of limited warfare with Ordoria in order to weaken them before they launch their inevitable all-out war on the Union."
 HLZ_army_officer_recruitment:0 "Replenish the Officer Corps"
 HLZ_army_officer_recruitment_desc:0 "Under Rosenblut, our Officer Corps, once the pride of our Army, has been thoroughly corrupted, leaving only thugs and foppish yes-men in its ranks, and even these fled during the fall of Rosenblut's regime. We have to rebuild our Officer Corps practically from scratch."
 HLZ_dockyard_improvements:0 "Re-Open the Dockyards"
 HLZ_dockyard_improvements_desc:0 "Once, Holzbrenn and even smaller coastal towns like Ruhigkuste used to be hubs of trade, though now our ports lay deserted, ships rotting in the docks. We will have to change this if we are to rebuild our economy and prevent Ordoria from just waltzing into our ports uncontested."
 HLZ_coastguard_fleet:0 "Counter Ordorian Piracy"
 HLZ_coastguard_fleet_desc:0 "In recent years, Ordorian piracy has become a real problem. We have managed to avoid most of it so far by virtue of all our trading having come to a grinding halt thanks to Rosenblut, but as merchant ships seek to dock in Reichsand once more, we will have to prepare an answer to these pirating Elves."
 HLZ_freiprinz_kriegsflottenmodelle:0 "Kriegsflottenmodell Meerschild"
 HLZ_freiprinz_kriegsflottenmodelle_desc:0 "Though our new coastal defence ships are capable of seeing off Ordorian pirates, they stand little chance against a full-on invasion force. We will have to prepare heavier models of ships to defend our waters in case of war."
 HLZ_marineeinheit:0 "Meersoldaten"
 HLZ_marineeinheit_desc:0 "Though our army has always been a prestigious posting, barring during the dark times of Kaspar's reign, the Navy has never been seen as quite as respectable. We will have to change this, and we can begin by creating a specialist regiment of 'Sea Soldiers'."
 HLZ_naval_invasion_specialization:0 "Joint Naval Invasion Training"
 HLZ_naval_invasion_specialization_desc:0 "Our Marine Corps looks tough on paper, but we have yet to see how well they can handle themselves in a field excercise. By arranging a mock invasion with another Freiprinztum, we can learn more than by trying our warriors against our own methods, and share our knowledge in the process."
 HLZ_restore_the_former_glory:0 "Finish the Militärerneuerung"
 HLZ_restore_the_former_glory_desc:0 "We have rebuilt our army to its former power, and proven it in the fires of battle against the Ordorian fiend. We can truly claim that Holzbrenn's army is once again one of the finest the Union has to offer!"
 HLZ_the_fate_of_the_aristocracy:0 "The fate of the Aristocracy"
 HLZ_the_fate_of_the_aristocracy_desc:0 "With a new, Republican order in place, the rulers of old must be dealt with. The aristocrats of Holzbrenn still cling on to their titles as if they mean anything, but we know that all are born equal."
 HLZ_redden_the_blue_blood:0 "Redden the Blue Blood"
 HLZ_redden_the_blue_blood_desc:0 "While those nobles that treated their people unjustly must be dealt with, we cannot fault an aristocrat for believing in a system he was taught from birth to believe in, outdated or not. However, this does not make their ideas about society correct. We will have to educate them into proper citizens of the Republic!"
 HLZ_officers_and_diplomats:0 "Officers and Diplomats"
 HLZ_officers_and_diplomats_desc:0 "Though some nobles are completely oblivious to how the world works for the common man, being bought up at court does carry some undeniable educational perks. Many are skilled commanders, and others are gifted orators and well-versed in courtly etiquette, perfectly suitable as diplomats. We are in sore need of both."
 HLZ_exile_the_nobility:0 "Exile the Nobility"
 HLZ_exile_the_nobility_desc:0 "The nobles cannot be tolerated in our Republican society. Many have relatives in other courts, or even holdings outside of Holzbrenn. Let them go there and no longer be a thorn in our side."
 HLZ_compensation_for_losses:0 "Compensation for Losses"
 HLZ_compensation_for_losses_desc:0 "Even though it goes against our Republican ideals to let the nobles take their wealth with them - we'd rather see it go to our people instead - the reality of the situation is that many Freiprinzen are already calling for a military invasion of Holzbrenn to 'restore the natural order of things'. We will have to compensate the exiled nobility in order to appease the rest of the Union."
 HLZ_seize_the_wealth:0 "Seize the Wealth"
 HLZ_seize_the_wealth_desc:0 "The aristocracy was a parasitic institution, leeching off the wealth created by those that worked in the fields and the workshops. Their hoarded wealth shall go to benefit our people."
 HLZ_egalitarianism:0 "Egalitarianism"
 HLZ_egalitarianism_desc:0 "We have built a revolutionary society here in Holzbrenn, based on radical ideas of equality of all. Egalitarianism shall be our guiding light into the future."
 HLZ_titular_titles:0 "Titular Titles"
 HLZ_titular_titles_desc:0 "We have already stripped the nobility of their power. If their petty titles are so important to the nobility, let them keep their fancy surnames. That should placate both our homegrown nobles and the Freiprinzen abroad."
 HLZ_reassure_the_freiprinzen:0 "Reassure the Freiprinzen"
 HLZ_reassure_the_freiprinzen_desc:0 "Though our own nobility has mostly adjusted to their new social position, many Freiprinzen are still anxious, worrying that we will export our Republican ideals to their lands. Let us make sure they do not see us as a threat."
 HLZ_reintegrate_the_aristocrats:0 "Re-Integrate the Aristocrats"
 HLZ_reintegrate_the_aristocrats_desc:0 "From the fires of Revolution, we have forged a new society, and though this has not gone without issue, we have by and large succeeded in a peaceful transition from feudal to Republican society. Let us make sure all of our nobility is on board with this."
 HLZ_new_governance:0 "New Governance"
 HLZ_new_governance_desc:0 "With a Republican system in place, we need a method of electing our government. There are various ways to go about this, and even now the government is fiercely debating which electoral method suits our people best."
 HLZ_zentralrepublik:0 "Zentralrepublik"
 HLZ_zentralrepublik_desc:0 "The weight of one man's vote must not be influenced by where in Holzbrenn they live! Each vote shall count equally in determining our government. As our people are concentrated in the capital, this method has earned the moniker of 'Central Republic', for its supposed privileging of the city."
 HLZ_wahlkreise:0 "Wahlkreise"
 HLZ_wahlkreise_desc:0 "Local concerns must not be left in obscurity, simply because our rural population isn't as concentrated as those in the city! By introducing electoral districts, we can make sure our people have a local connection to their representative in government, and make sure the voices of our rural citizens are not drowned out by city-folk."
 HLZ_lokalraete:0 "Lokalräte"
 HLZ_lokalraete_desc:0 "Decentralization is key! Local problems require local solutions, and we must devolve our government as much as possible to regional councils, to make sure that power is not concentrated in a national government at the expense of regional and local concerns."
 HLZ_purple_seats:0 "Purple Seats"
 HLZ_purple_seats_desc:0 "As a final concession to aristocratic forces in the Union, in order to make absolutely sure the Freiprinzen will give us full co-operation, we shall reserve a small amount of seats in the Citizen's Assembly for the most influential noble families."
 HLZ_equal_opportunity:0 "Equal Opportunities"
 HLZ_equal_opportunity_desc:0 "All are equal in the eyes of the Republic, and so all must have equal ability to stand for election. We shall neither privilege nor hinder those aristocrats that seek to represent our people in the Assembly."
 HLZ_ban_aristocrats_from_elections:0 "Ban Aristocrats from Elections"
 HLZ_ban_aristocrats_from_elections_desc:0 "Never again must the nobility be able to seize power in Holzbrenn! We will ban anyone from an aristocratic family from standing in elections, to make sure that no aristocrat shall never again hold power in their grubby little hands."
 HLZ_pressler_triumphant:0 "Pressler Triumphant"
 HLZ_pressler_triumphant_desc:0 "The rebellion has been crushed by Pressler's counter-revolution! He has proclaimed himself Freiprinz of Holzbrenn, and already has begun undoing most of the revolutionaries' reforms. The light of Revolution has been snuffed out in Holzbrenn."
 HLZ_deal_dissenters:0 "Deal with Dissenters"
 HLZ_deal_dissenters_desc:0 "Even though their organized resistance has been crushed, many of our subjects still resent our rule and long for a second revolt. We will have to crush these rebellious spirits."
 HLZ_dissent_republicans:0 "Round up Republicans"
 HLZ_dissent_republicans_desc:0 "The Republicans are among some of the worst agitators and rabble-rousers in the Freiprinztum, with their ridiculous notions of 'liberty' and 'unalienable rights'. They will have to be broken, and their organizations disbanded."
 HLZ_dissent_nobles:0 "Neuter the Nobility"
 HLZ_dissent_nobles_desc:0 "Although they were mostly quiet during Rosenblut's reign, the aristocracy was quick to denounce him once it became clear which side the pendulum would swing. They will have to be stripped of their titles and possessions and replaced by more loyal subjects."
 HLZ_geheimpolizei:0 "Geheimpolizei"
 HLZ_geheimpolizei_desc:0 "Though organized resistance to our regime has been utterly crushed, there are still secret cells of rebels that meet in clandestine taverns and shady alleyways, plotting against Freiprinz Pressler. We will have to create a secret police to counter these threats."
 HLZ_conscription:0 "Reinstate Conscription"
 HLZ_conscription_desc:0 "The rebels abolished conscription for some silly utopian reason or the other. We are far less given to such harmful flights of idealism. Every body we can throw at our enemies is necessary, and therefore we will reintroduce the draft."
 HLZ_ban_arms:0 "Ban Ownership of Arms"
 HLZ_ban_arms_desc:0 "One of the biggest reasons the Revolution succeeded was that any peasant was allowed to own weapons. Though we will have to allow more rural commoners to own spears and axes, we will ban all other forms of weapon ownership."
 HLZ_iron_discipline:0 "Demand Iron Discipline"
 HLZ_iron_discipline_desc:0 "Rosenblut's generals were inexcusably lax, and this is what caused the army to defect to the rebels. We will demand the strictest obedience from our troops, to prevent further defections in the future."
 HLZ_gotter_freiprinz:0 "Für Götter und Freiprinz"
 HLZ_gotter_freiprinz_desc:0 "The army has been whipped back into shape and, more importantly, obedience. They march for the Gods and Freiprinz Pressler, and will crush our enemies, both in and out!"
 HLZ_staatsrason:0 "Der Staatsräson"
 HLZ_staatsrason_desc:0 "The rebels would have led Holzbrenn to ruin with their ideological commitments abroad, but we are more pragmatic. We shall pursue our national interests and formulate only realistic foreign policy, rather than concern ourselves with wishful thinking."
 HLZ_placate_church:0 "Placate the Church"
 HLZ_placate_church_desc:0 "We must legitimize our government, and the first step in this is gaining the support of the Church of the Seven. Pressler will promise to fund seven new temples in Holzbrenn, one for each deity."
 HLZ_placate_adalina:0 "Placate Adalina"
 HLZ_placate_adalina_desc:0 "The Hochprinzessin must publicly support our claim on the Holzbrenner Freithron, or else all we have done will be for naught. Significant political concessions to Adalina should sway her to support our cause."
 HLZ_our_place:0 "Our Place in the Union"
 HLZ_our_place_desc:0 "Though Adalina is the official Hochprinzessin, Schwarzenbach has been clandestinely gathering support to seize the Freithron from her and become Hochprinz himself. We will have to judge which side we back, or even stake our own claim."
 HLZ_coronation_pressler:0 "The Coronation of Pressler"
 HLZ_coronation_pressler_desc:0 "With our reign secure and legitimate, and our internal opposition crushed, we can finally formalize Pressler's claim on Holzbrenn's Prinzthron in a grand ceremony!"
